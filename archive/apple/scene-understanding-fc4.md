We need some shared and shareable understanding of use cases for scene understanding in perception - this fits within [Perception use cases](https://quip-apple.com/sXoMATA1LVaC).
Basically start with all the Tasks that moidels can do and list out all experiences that the device will support. Then work with HI to map out for them how a set of tasks (object detection, instance seg, visual triggers etc) can deliver the experience that they are going for. The breakdown table that Humphrey showed is helpful to list out all the constituent technologies He just needs someone to break down all the use cases in a way to create a shared and shareable understanding. So if there are new VLMs or multimodal models they can get slotted in.
