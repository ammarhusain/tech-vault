	- In addition to regulation that requires the marking of AI generated content, it will also be helpful if regulation can be introduced that legally incentivises the use of licensed content, rather than unlicensed scraped content, when used as training data. Moreover, developers of AI models and creators of training datasets should be required to collect, retain and disclose auditable records regarding the sources of materials used to train AI models.
	- Producers of editorial news content need to be able to negotiate on a level playing field with AI model operators and developers regarding access to and use of their intellectual property. Those participants in the news ecosystem that produce primary source journalism must have the choice about whether to allow their content to be used to train generative AI. This will enable them to insist on safeguards to ensure that generative AI outputs complement rather than compete with their own news services. If they elect to allow their content to be used, they should be compensated for the use of their works.

	- Across all the lawsuits we see a common set of core allegations and legal questions.
		- Does training a large language model with copyrighted works constitute fair use?
		- Can content generated by LLMs infringe a copyright?
		- Will court rulings be differentiated depending on if the content was a  direct replication, paraphrasing, imitation, or parody?
		- Does the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) provide a legal remedy to take down potentially infringing material generated by AI?
		- Do AI generated images that strip copyright or trademark symbols violate DMCA ?
		- Does scraping content to train models constitute unauthorized use of personal information and infringe privacy and consumer rights?
	- In one of the earliest [cases](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/13/24072131/sarah-silverman-paul-tremblay-openai-chatgpt-copyright-lawsuit), involving the comedian Sarah Silverman, the judge dismissed 5 of the 6 complaints against Open AI, including the DMCA ones, leaving open only one charge on whether or not there was a direct infringement. We see a similar pattern play out in a different court room last week where a US district judge advanced [claims](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/artists-score-major-win-copyright-case-against-ai-art-generators-1235973601/) of copyright infringement against Stable Diffusion and Midjourney while dismissing those tied to DMCA and unjust enrichment.

### Resources
**Technical**:
An interesting data quality benchmark challenge. Here the model is fixed but the data quality is what matters. This is a good benchmark to use for Crawlspace
[DataComp](https://www.datacomp.ai/dclm/index.html#home) - they have a DCLM-Tool
DataComp centers the role that data plays by fixing the training code, and encouraging researchers to innovate by proposing new training sets. We provide an experimental testbed centered around a new candidate pool of 240T tokens from Common Crawl. Participants in our benchmark design new filtering techniques or curate new data sources and then evaluate them by running our standardized language model training code followed by an evaluation on 53 downstream datasets.

### Meditations
- #journal/meditations #crawlspace 
	- Do not overthink the landing page or the pitch deck design early on - make rapid progress to get the product into a usable state. Find the right tools (Tome, Canva etc) and go with templates everywhere. There will be more time for branding later.
		- In Brazil I overthought the design of the pitch deck and website to a point where I lost track of the fact that we need a working prototype.
	- This has been a good exercise in learning full stack dev - its a valuable skill to rapidly prototype ideas

It boils down to deciding between these tools: helpful video - [These 6 No-Code Builders Will Let You Build ANYTHING In 2024 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3gFYvSX748)
Bubble: 
- most popular full feature no code web app builder - tons of integrations and supports full backend dev
- Cons: UI is not that great; cannot export code (so stuck staying on bubble)
Webflow + Wized:
- Webflow has a much stronger UI, responsive design etc
WeWeb (may be better option than Bubble if we have our own backend)
- Super strong & easy to use frontend 
- Will need to build & connect your own backend - Xano, Superbase etc.
CRUD functions: create, read, update data

Productive chat with Jakub. Take aways:
- We probably dont need a fullblown text search. Just a simple search over attributes/ tags of the dataset in the website
- Jakub brought a good point around Spawning AI and them trying to get paid sooner to offset the initial hosting costs by building the opt-in/out infra with ai.txt
	- We both agreed that its better for us to bear the upfront costs of hosting rather than raise barrier to entry for publishers.
- Need a python library that syntactically looks similar to huggingface (datasets) where users can specify a token id and download the dataset in the pytorch/huggingface dataloader format
- Jakub to continue building out crawling infra. Needs to chat more with buyers to understand their usecase: webbased search or programmatic access. 
	- Introduced Jakub with Giel

[Otter Meeting notes](https://otter.ai/u/bQBR-IE0jLh9fLkOthaf4Ke-YW4?tab=chat&view=summary)
- [ ] Look into LlamaIndex and how that hooks up with other Vector DBs
- Recommended VespaDB as the best open source one. ChromaDB is the simpler non scalable one.
	- These could be ones to fork and build an analytics variant on (he wouldn't really recommend it however)
- All vector DBs are pretty much the same.
- The vectorDB stores the embedding vector and an index. If you host the datastore that is where the index points to then you can bill providers based on queries hitting the file descriptors. This is a neat idea because anyway we need to be able to host the crawled data - so we can just expose that as an index to multiple vector databases too. We may or may not provide the embedding vectors.
	- This is potentially expensive as it involves a lot of data to host
	- He mentioned something around NVMe in AWS - dont know what that means
- OpenAI provides [chatgpt-retrieval-plugin](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin/tree/main/datastore) which works with several vector DBs as well.
- Another option could be setting up partnerships with a few vector DB companies that can create an analytics reporting mechanism for you in their solutions.


[Getty Images - Parliament committeee written evidence](https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/128393/pdf/)
Producers of editorial news content need to be able to negotiate on a level playing field with AI model operators and developers regarding access to and use of their intellectual property. Those participants in the news ecosystem that produce primary source journalism must have the choice about whether to allow their content to be used to train generative AI. This will enable them to insist on safeguards to ensure that generative AI outputs complement rather than compete with their own news services. If they elect to allow their content to be used, they should be compensated for the use of their works. In addition, in view of the fact that generative AI models are often trained on data obtained from a variety of sources, UK AI regulators should promote an environment where rights holders are able to work together to fairly license data, including with regard to licensing structures, without being held back by UK competition law.

 Long chat with Jakub where we discussed the [YC co-founder](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18qbKdv9hUCOzU90rxwP9b4cb2AgkPt4gWefgX0Isqak/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.os48zxs9ebi4) matching questions
 I do really think Jakub would be a great partner to build this [[archive/Crawlspace]] together with. Our thinking is very aligned and so are the ambitions. He mostly wants to do it for the sense of ownership. Seemed like he is also tired of working in companies for someone else. I think he would be patient to not just blindly scale but build something small to service niche markets rather than VC infused hypergrowth hype machine startups. Would be an interesting ride - I will just need to. make sure I can keep my ambitions contained!
 He does seem to be a bit concerned about drawing a salary pretty quickly which honestly might not be a bad thing but his expenses are pretty low and seems like he is not driven by overnight riches.
 As for work responsibilities we agreed on a rough split. In addition to customer acquisition though he wants to also focus on brand marketing which makes a lot of sense.

[OpenAI, Reddit Sign Partnership on ChatGPT, AI Products, Ads](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-reddit-sign-partnership-chatgpt-212947639.html)

[[2024-05-08-Wednesday]] - andreas mentioned that Apple can't use Common Crawl data because of legal restrictions: another interesting usecase.

Lunch with Adil Karrar at Lado's

- According to him it might constitute as fair use if an AI model uses data without proper content licensing to train. If it regurgitates content back that might be in violation of copyright
- Its important to make the distinction between something that is registered as copyright material with the statutory office and something thats not. In the first case the infringement automatically gets fined (eg: a movie is registered). In the second case the content creator must sue for damages and prove that harm was done due to infringement.
- He also cautioned about making a distinction between licensing and copyright. For ex MS Copilot violates licensing because it regurgitates code without proper attribution.
- According to him there might be a need for a marketplace. There could be different terms that content creators can sign on to the marketplace with - as in they allow use for pretraining but not regurgitation. His example was around images: ie you can use my images for training but cannot produce faces out of it or use it in pornographic content generation etc. It might just be worthwhile from a text POV to keep it simple 1) pretraining or 2) pretraining + regurgitation
- You could license with AI companies such that they provide model access to you to audit that terms are not violated: this might still be possible with large firms.
- Also need to be careful that people signing up actually have rights to their content and that they have not signed it off to some publisher/online platform. On that note - different platforms have different terms so definitely worth looking into too. According to him. Getty Images probably has a way of authenticating content that they put up on their marketplace.

Clem Delangue event at some VC office:
Made the same point as Adil - content creator might not be the rights holder
Emphasized that data might be more important than model in the future
Hasn't seen anything interesting in the LLM agent space. Does not buy the LLM hype - thinks its transient

Chatted with Giel (Ycombinator cofounder matching portal):
He is working on a Legal AI product that would explain complex legal jargon to noobs. Also in law school on the side. Sounds like his company would be very interested in purchasing niche domain specific data through this marketplace. He seemed to love the idea as they are already having this problem of sourcing high quality legal data thats currently behind paywalls - startup could be a great first customer / early adopter.
His advise: focus on a few sectors and deepen there.
He will intro me to others who specialize in IP law and could potentially serve as partners or advisors. Might also be interesting to know the various publishers in different countries that this data could be purchased fromeg: Oxford in the UK, Thomas Writers (US)

[Major U.S. newspapers sue Microsoft, OpenAI for copyright infringement](https://www.axios.com/2024/04/30/microsoft-openai-lawsuit-copyright-newspapers-alden-global)

Had a great chat with Jakub Hadak (met through YCombinator co-founder matching). I think our visions & motivation are super aligned. Definitely felt like someone I could partner up to work with. In his mind he was approaching it more from a web crawlers perspective where people can list their URLs for the scraper to scrape from. Different view than mine where I was looking at it more from a partnerships lens where we onboard newspapers for example. I also considered this more like Getty Images whereas he thought about it more as Merlin Network for music. Both of which are useful analogies

[Getty Images (UK) Ltd—written evidence (LLM0054) House of Lords Communications and Digital Select Committee inquiry: Large language models](https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/124278/pdf/)

- Where LLMs are developed using copyright protected data from a variety of different sources, and considering the huge financial investments required to develop LLMs which act as a natural barrier to all but large, well-resourced technology companies from building their own LLMs, its important that rights holders are able to achieve a degree of parity in any licensing discussions with the builders of LLMs.
- UK AI regulation is an opportunity to maintain this respect for IP and to create mechanisms that promote efficient, ethical and legal data licensing markets. Specifically, regulation should require providers of LLMs and other generative models bear two important responsibilities: (i) disclose information on the training data that their systems use where this is protected under copyright law (as one of the above Transparency obligations); and (ii) ensure they only use datasets subject to appropriate data governance measures.
- Unintended consequences can be mitigated by licensing training data at the outset, thus securing necessary permissions to IP rights and warranties as to accuracy. Licensing in this way might also make it possible to include links within search results to where relevant data used for training is published, allowing users to verify search results as well as providing credit and compensation to the owners of that data, i.e. via referral traffic linking to where that data is published online.

Met Slavo at the networking event yesterday - his company might be pretty good to create a quick and dirty marketplace prototype.

[[2024-04-07-Sunday]] -

- There will likely be several small publishers (like blog post writers, newspapers) that would like to monetize their works when used for AI model training. At the same time there will likely be several smaller companies building domain specific AI models (outside of the OpenAI, Google) that would rather not need to negotiate independent contracts for access to data.
- It would be great if there was a centralized marketplace that offers publishers the ability to monetize on their creation while resolving legal copyright disputes for small AI companies.
- Data could be sold as a one off transaction or there could be a royalty based model
	- For a loyalty based model it would be interesting to see what data source might have contributed in inference (if that is even possible)
	- For one of data sold - is it a one time fee? Or is it per model type? Or yearly?
- Need to have a flag for real, AI assisted and AI generated content
	- What is the SoTA research in detecting AI generated content?
- My pitch - I have been a machine learning software engineer for several years working on AV and general robotics. The way we collected data has always been interesting - but at least data collection was a very self driven problem. In contrast these language model companies have just come out and scraped the internet for free while attemtpting to make billions of dollars through that. We need to empower and reward creators such that it does not come to get dominated by a few AI behemoths. It needs to be democratized. Lets not let AI become the Internet. I think crypto had the same appeal - decentralized platforms but then it lacked a core product (currency, store of value?)
[[2024-04-15-Monday-W16|2024-04-17-Wednesday]] Found this quote in the Tech Review newsletter
“They have created an amazing edifice that’s built on a foundation of sand.”
—Dan Hunter, a professor of law at King’s College London, tells [the Economist](https://technologyreview.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=47c1a9cec9749a8f8cbc83e78&id=3af71acdda&e=8613610fdf) that the first wave of companies to cash in on the AI boom are anxiously awaiting a rash of lawsuits from the rights holders of the data their models were trained on.
