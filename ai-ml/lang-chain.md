A lot of the magic is being hid in thisÂ `VectorstoreIndexCreator`. What is this doing?
There are three main steps going on after the documents are loaded:
1. Splitting documents into chunks
2. Creating embeddings for each document
3. Storing documents and embeddings in a vectorstore
My [[code-junkyard/second-brain-web-search/second-brain-web-search]] could be built much simpler using these langchain indexes. I end up doing the same stuff with custom python code - [Obsidian â€” ðŸ¦œðŸ”— LangChain 0.0.186](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/document_loaders/examples/obsidian.html)
