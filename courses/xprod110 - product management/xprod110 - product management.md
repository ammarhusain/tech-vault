## Module 2: Overview of the Product Lifecycle

### Pre-reading

[https://joshelman.medium.com/a-product-managers-job-63c09a43d0ec](https://joshelman.medium.com/a-product-managers-job-63c09a43d0ec)

The job of a product manager is to : Help your team (and company) ship the right product to your users

- Spend all their time on highest priority things: coordination and communication
- They could articulate how beating the goals and metrics of their product would bolster the company’s overall strategy.

[https://medium.com/@johnv/the-bipolar-nature-of-product-management-6c534479d2e9](https://medium.com/@johnv/the-bipolar-nature-of-product-management-6c534479d2e9)

- **Strategic vs Execution Focused**
- **Divergent vs Convergent Thinking**
- **Vision vs Data Driven**
- **Consensus Building vs Making the Hard Call**
- **Bringing the Donuts (do whatever is needed - aka janitor) vs Ruthless Management of Time (prioritize the most important)**

[https://svpg.com/what-product-management-is-not/](https://svpg.com/what-product-management-is-not/)

Product manager is responsible for discovering a product that is useful, usable and feasible. If he can do this, he’s done his job.

- Product Management is not defining the business case
- Product Management is not defining market requirements
- Product Management is not requirements gathering
	 - customers have issues that need to be addressed, but they are not in a position to dictate the product requirements. In other words, you can’t make the mistake of confusing a customer requirement with a product requirement.
- Product Management is not project management
- Product Management is not product marketing

[https://caseyaccidental.com/product-visionary-vs-product-leader/amp/](https://caseyaccidental.com/product-visionary-vs-product-leader/amp/)

What does a product leader do at a tech company? It’s actually very little of creating a vision and a strategy from scratch. It’s about helping everyone understand what the vision and strategy is. It’s about communicating to the entire team why the company is doing what it is doing. It’s about building a process that helps a team execute on that vision. It’s about when there are competing visions, aligning and motivating the team to focus on one, and getting people to disagree and commit (including sometimes yourself). It’s about looking at data to measure if product changes are having a positive impact on the customer and the company’s growth. It’s about talking to users to understand why they’re doing what they’re doing, and the problems they still face even though your product exists.

[https://a16z.com/2012/06/15/good-product-managerbad-product-manager/](https://a16z.com/2012/06/15/good-product-managerbad-product-manager/)

Good product manager takes full responsibility (no excuses)

- Good product managers crisply define the target, the “what” (as opposed to the how) and manage the delivery of the “what.” Bad product managers feel best about themselves when they figure out “how”.
- Good product managers take written positions on important issues. Bad product managers voice their opinion verbally and lament that the “powers that be” won’t let it happen.
- Good product managers decompose problems. Bad product managers combine all problems into one.
- Good product managers define their job and their success. Bad product managers constantly want to be told what to do.

[https://adamnash.blog/2011/12/16/be-a-great-product-leader/](https://adamnash.blog/2011/12/16/be-a-great-product-leader/)

Three sets of communication responsibilities for a great Product Leader

1. Product Strategy

	 Articulate two simple things:

	 - What game are we playing?
	 - How do we keep score?
2. Prioritization
3. Execution

	 In the end, product managers ship, and that means that product managers cover whatever gaps in the process that need to be covered.

[https://medium.com/all-things-product-management/product-manager-you-are-664d83ee702e](https://medium.com/all-things-product-management/product-manager-you-are-664d83ee702e)

As a PM you are:

- CEO
- Coach
	 - Keeps things in perspective. Remains the optimist. Removes distractions. Tells stories and stirs the imagination. Points the way to victory.
- Engineer
- Hammer
	 - you need to be the force that makes things happen. You don’t let people equivocate; you make people commit to a clear position and establish course of action. You drive to resolution. You don’t let loose ends stay loose and you prevent things from falling through cracks. You are the propellant that pushes through all opposition and ultimately gets the product shipped.
- Router of information
	 - You’ll need to know the org cold in order to be good at this, and the more personal relationships you can establish the more effective your routing will be.
- Super user of the product
- Inventor
- Ghost
	 - Know when to disappear and get out of the way and be available if needed.
- The Product

[https://speakerdeck.com/kennethn/leading-cross-functional-teams-and-the-product-manager?slide=22](https://speakerdeck.com/kennethn/leading-cross-functional-teams-and-the-product-manager?slide=22)

- You will not be closely supervised. Little to no authority will be handed to you. You will be highly accountable for success.
- 7 +/- 2 is the right sized team to first start with.
- Get respect from Engineers:
	 - Always take the blame
	 - Ask smart questions
	 - Explain the “Why”
- Get respect from Executives:
	 - Have a vision
	 - Be patient
	 - Know your competition
	 - Make your commitments
- Get respect from customers:
	 - Understand what they want
	 - Take the blame and keep your promises

Three things to remember:

- Dont tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do
- Communicate to different people in their own language
- Represent the poiunts of view of the people not in the room.

### Lecture

PM started with a memo in 1931 by Neil McEnroy (working at Proctor & Gamble). - called it brand man ... responsible for managing the product holistically to unify marketing and actual product development.

HP adopted it, then Microsoft then Google.

PM sits at the intersection of Design, Engineering & Business

#### Core Principles
- You’re both the CEO and the janitor
	 - you own the vision and also the clean up
- Zooming in up and down from the vision to the bugs
	 - pitch to executives and then check your bug backlogs
- Inter and intra team communication
	 - You are the glue of your team and router of information. You interface between different teams.
- Influence without authority
- Know your User (most important)
- Bring the donuts
	 - be there for your team, inspire and boost morale, cheer everyone up when the going gets tough

#### Product Lifecycle

Generic framework for solvingtake a single idea from start to finish

1. Evaluate Opportunity (”what”)

	 Figure out what problem you are solving, and why its important. Who is your customer? How are you capturing value?

2. Design Solution (”how”)

	 Create a very large number of solutions. Divergent and then converge on the solution you wanna execute on.

3. Build (”how”)

	 Get it done... comes down to interpersonal skills, technical ability etc.

4. Ship

	 Get your product into the hands of your customers

5. Measure

	 Quantify if you actually solved the problem

6. Iterate

This process is not sequential. It is a series of iterative processes, very similar to the scientific method (but applied to business) ... Always ask yourself: what is my goal and how do I know when I am done with this portion of the piece?

## Module 3: Understanding the Problem Space

### Pre-reading

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2012/02/19/jurassic-park-how-pg-brought-febreze-back-to-life/?sh=25a51ebb7f6d](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2012/02/19/jurassic-park-how-pg-brought-febreze-back-to-life/?sh=25a51ebb7f6d)

[http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/11/five-whys.html](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/11/five-whys.html)

- Use the technique of asking why five times to get to the root cause of the problem.
	 - *This could be pretty relevant when trying to figure out how to get robot interventions down. “Why did it not work?”*
- What started as a technical problem actually turned out to be a human and process problem. Our bias as technologists is to over-focus on the product part of the problem, and five whys tends to counteract that tendency.

[http://giffconstable.com/2012/12/12-tips-for-early-customer-development-interviews-revision-3/](http://giffconstable.com/2012/12/12-tips-for-early-customer-development-interviews-revision-3/)

- One person at a time
- Know your goals and questions ahead of time
- Separate behavior and feedback in discussion
- Get psyched to hear things you didn’t want to hear
- Disarm “politeness” training: make them give you raw honest answers
- Ask open ended questions
- People *love* to talk about features and solutions. When you are in learning mode, don’t let that dominate the conversation. Try to keep things factual. Get them to tell you stories about problems they face
- Listen, dont talk
- Follow your nose and drill down: Ask the Five Whys
- Parrot back or misrepresent to confirm
- Ask for introductions for 1 to 3 people on who to talk to next
- Write up your notes as quickly and as immediately as possible

[https://gigaom.com/2012/09/15/not-enough-time-to-save-time-the-value-of-rapid-ethnography/](https://gigaom.com/2012/09/15/not-enough-time-to-save-time-the-value-of-rapid-ethnography/)

- *Talk about benefits of ethnography. Not super relevant or great*

[https://medium.com/indian-thoughts/seven-lessons-i-learned-from-the-failure-of-my-first-startup-dinnr-c166d1cfb8b8](https://medium.com/indian-thoughts/seven-lessons-i-learned-from-the-failure-of-my-first-startup-dinnr-c166d1cfb8b8)

- **You must never, ever, pitch the product to the customer** and ask for their feedback. Figure out their **big enough problem: don’t ask about their future intentions (“would you buy this?”), but do ask about PAST behavior.**
- You can develop yourself towards stepping up to the opportunity. But you can’t conjure up an opportunity to suit your current skill level.
- Spend more time beforehand to investigate metrics that we need to hit in order to continue.

[https://www.cindyalvarez.com/how-do-customer-development-and-product-management-fit-together-2014/](https://www.cindyalvarez.com/how-do-customer-development-and-product-management-fit-together-2014/)

- Talking to your customers does not mean asking them what they want and writing it all down. It also doesn’t mean that you can talk to customers and somehow, magically, from all of their words, a product will appear.

[https://brantcooper.com/brants-rant/how-to-find-early-adopters/](https://brantcooper.com/brants-rant/how-to-find-early-adopters/)

[https://www.bringthedonuts.com/essays/how-to-listen-to-customers.html](https://www.bringthedonuts.com/essays/how-to-listen-to-customers.html)

[https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/start-talking/](https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/start-talking/)

Build rapport, dont go in with a script and actively listen.

Make them feel like they are an expert and you are privileged to speak with them — which is really the truth.

Be sure to use their name as much as possible

Record the talk — don’t go crazy with notes.

Dont ask leading questions:

DON’T SAY: How angry were you when the app didn’t start up properly?

DO SAY: What were you feeling when the app didn’t start up properly?

### Lecture

Framework for finding a problem worth solving:

- Defining success
	 - If we can achieve X outcome with Y input, then it is a success.
	 - Write this down ahead of time.
- Choosing a customer
	 - Usually B2B or B2C. Figuring out who you are trying to sell to and capture value from.
	 - Tip: Choose a customer you have a deep understanding for
- Problem vs Opportunities
	 - Problem: unmet need, want or desire of your customer
	 - Opportunity: idea that has been validated to be both good for the user & good for the company (Apple is the perfect example)
	 - Need to capture meaningful economic value from the problem
- Problem Space vs Solution Space
	 - Need to draw a very clear line between the two
	 - As a PM you must listen to your customers description of a solution space and map it to the problem they are trying to solve.
	 - Problem space: no solutions allowed, understand your customers reality
	 - Solution space: clear problem statement, focus on how to solve
	 - Problem space is entirely defined by the customers. You do not influence it at all, it has nothing to do with you.
	 - Have a desire to solve the problem, not to be attached to your solutions.
	 - “I think ***our customers think*** the world works this way” (formulate your sentences like this)
- Market Sizing
	 - you need a market capable of achieving your objectives
	 - sets a rough upper bound on the value of your business.
	 - Nested russian dolls defining the markets
		  - Total addressable market (TAM): total revenue opportunity available in your category (largest number).
		  - Serviceable addressable market (SAM): portion of the market you can actually reach given the competencies you have today.
		  - Target market (TM): people that you are actually trying to reach (smallest number)
	 - Tips:
		  - Make sure TAM is 2+ orders of magnitude bigger than your success criteria
		  - Don’t worry too much about over-precision
		  - TAM is very top-down outside driven - hire firms like Gartner or read research reports.
		  - Target market is almost always driven by you - given the number of sales people, product capability etc.
- User Research Tips & Tricks
	 - Core PM skill: Represent your customer inside your build, build a mental model of them so you can simulate what they think and need when work with your teams.
	 - Customer Identification: Pick the customers that match your market
	 - Customer Segmentation: Note key differences between them
	 - Quantitative Analysis: good for talking to huge amounts of people... surveys etc.
	 - Qualitative Analysis: 1:1 interviews ... do around 10-15 ... you start seeing patterns in 7-10
		  - Write your script ahead of time. Start with the easy background questions
		  - Move to targeted questions about potential problems. Day in the life type interviews are great
		  - End with open-ended questions: “is there anything else you wanna bring up?”
	 - Customer interviews are fundamentally about listening to the world and not convince the world about frame of mind
	 - Reach out to people you dont know. Build rapport and be human
	 - Be curious. Keep asking “Why” (Five whys) to follow a few threads
	 - Don’t try to get the answers you want and don’t be disorganized

## Module 4 : Designing the Solution

### Pre-reading

In the Define mode, you should end up creating an actionable problem statement which is commonly known as the [Point of View](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/point-of-view) (POV) in Design Thinking. You should always base your Point Of View on a deeper understanding of your specific users, their needs and your most essential insights about them.

![Untitled](courses/xprod110%20-%20product%20management/attachments/Untitled%208.png)

You articulate a POV by combining these three elements – user, need, and insight – as an actionable problem statement that will drive the rest of your design work.

“If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.”

– Albert Einstein

[https://modus.medium.com/the-difference-between-good-and-great-designers-fd6d4d8bd813](https://modus.medium.com/the-difference-between-good-and-great-designers-fd6d4d8bd813)

- Great design strips away all possible interpretations of intent, leaving only one.
- By figuring out why a problem exists in the first place, a great designer doesn’t just mitigate its effects — she can eliminate the problem completely.
- a designer must exercise deliberate thinking to distill the problem to one indisputable fact — [the foundation or the first principle.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle) Not “what is the problem?” but “why is the problem?”
- Myriad ways to solve any given problem exist but only one may be optimal — the one that eliminates it altogether.

[https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/prototyping-learn-eight-common-methods-and-best-practices](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/prototyping-learn-eight-common-methods-and-best-practices)

- When prototyping, pay attention to four key considerations: people, objects, location, and interactions. These factors will affect how your prototype will work
- you can build prototypes based on any of the eight methods we’ve just covered: sketches, paper interfaces, storyboards, [Lego prototypes](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/lego-prototypes), role-playing, physical models, Wizard of Oz prototypes, and user-driven prototypes.

- A minimum viable product is not always a smaller/cheaper version of your final product
- Think about cheap hacks to test the goal. ***Do things that do not scale***

- *Nothing super interesting other than do short research sprints to prototype ideas rather than Build, Test, Launch, Iterate cycles.*

[pretotype_it_2nd_pretotype_edition-2.pdf](courses/xprod110%20-%20product%20management/attachments/pretotype_it_2nd_pretotype_edition-2.pdf)

- Pretotype: Prototype by pretending that you have solved the problem. See how usable it is.
- The speech-to-text and Palm Pilot stories have several things in common.
Both teams had doubts about the eventual usefulness and adoption of their
innovation. It was a cool idea. It made sense. It solved a problem. But
was it the right it? Would people actually use it?
- Testing the initial appeal and actual usage of a potential new product by simulating its core experience with the smallest possible investment of time and money.
- Thoughtland is a fictional place inhabited by two strange entities that float around and interact with each other: ideas and opinions. More precisely: unrealized ideas and opinions about those unrealized ideas.
- Thoughtland is a very safe place for ideas because, until they are actually converted into something more tangible such as a rough prototype of an app or the first draft of a book or script, they cannot fail. The only thing an abstract idea can “produce” is an opinion, something even more abstract and of even more dubious value.

### Lecture

Framework for how to ideate for solutions: Diamond design - Divergence and Convergence

Write down Opportunity statements → “How might we”

“How” assumes that there is a solution out there

“might” means we are not still sure that this solution will solve the problem

“we” indicates that this solution can be done jointly by us.

Ex: “How might we make cyclists more visible to cars?”

Brainstorm tips:

Brainstorm [HMW statements](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase1-understand/hmw-sharing-and-affinity-mapping)

- Write down your customer problems and success criteria.
- Jot down several “How might we” opportunity statements & ideas in your group
- Collect those ideas and categorize/bucket them together.
- As follow up questions to discover more “How might we’s”
- Consider segmenting your customers
- Perception is just as valuable as reality

Brainstorm solution to a particular HMW statement

- Crazy 8s: 8 ideas in 8 minutes (Divergence phase of thinking)
- Draw ideas to remember & visualize
- Collect and cluster ideas → identify themes
- Emerging strong themes help identify possible solutions

Divergence in ideas brainstorming must adhere to Design Constraints - what is true about your customer, your problem or your company that eliminates classes of solutions.

![Screen Shot 2022-01-12 at 12.40.26.png](courses/xprod110%20-%20product%20management/attachments/Screen_Shot_2022-01-12_at_12.40.26.png)

Design constraints help prioritize and then eliminate “How might We’s”

Repeat brainstorm with each audience segment

Cleaning Case Study: (invention of Swiffer)

P&G did a bunch of [[courses/xprod115 - user research/xprod115 - user research|user research]] to see how people were cleaning their homes (process was the same for ~100 years). They found the following key elements:

- People changed to old dirty clothes
- Swept the floor first
- Mopping was messy with water splashing everywhere

HMW statements team brainstormed:

- HMW reimagine the tools we use to mop
	 - HMW remove the step of sweeping before mopping
	 - HMW build a tool that people don’t have to touch dirt
	 - HMW create a mop that could attract dirt to itself?

**Divergent Thinking Recap:**

![Screen Shot 2022-01-12 at 13.05.22.png](courses/xprod110%20-%20product%20management/attachments/Screen_Shot_2022-01-12_at_13.05.22.png)

- Start with a very clear problem statement
- Establish your design constraints
- Create very thoughtful HMW statements
- Structure your solutions brainstorming.

### Convergent Thinking

Make decision based on what is important to de-risk

- Palm pilot example where people carried a cardboard dummy in their pockets with the UI draw out
- List your assumptions and rank them on what you are most unsure about

How to prototype cheaply?

- Do it manually
- Use tools like Sketch, Figma, Keynote to visualize flow → graphically depict
- Usability testing: Does this prototype work for the customer? (5-10 users)
	 - Never take what the customer to be exactly what they mean
	 - Remain neutral and “I didnt design this” to get the most honest feedback
	 - Questions to ask the users/interviewees: (ask open-ended questions)
		  - What is this for?
		  - What do you think when you see this?
		  - What do you expect that will do?
		  - What would you do next? Why?

**Convergence Recap**

- Use prototyping to de-risk
- Identify key assumptions and test them
- Look for ways to test ideas cheaply
- Maintain quality where necessary

Design: Voice of the user, Product: Voice of the business

Design Process; User-centric and iterative

### Exercise 4.1

Brainstorm 8 ideas in 8 minutes about your problem (”human in the loop”)

- Automatically trigger an event when a human gets involved
- Have the human trigger an intervention event
- Do usability tests on the tools they use and how long it takes them to address issues
- Try to remove the environmental roadblock: if the door is closed manually open it, require chairs to be out of the way, move the latch on the door
- Use confidence values from the perception system to indicate it is not confident about something
- Before launching a new service, joystick the robot around manually to make sure it can do the task.

## Module 5 : Launching

### Pre-reading

[https://neilpatel.com/blog/ab-testing-introduction/](https://neilpatel.com/blog/ab-testing-introduction/)

- *Article about A/B testing ... pretty meh*

[https://amplitude.com/blog/product-metrics](https://amplitude.com/blog/product-metrics)

- before you release any new product or feature, **set a measurable target that will determine whether or not the release was successful**.
- as a [[career/management|product manager]], you should **insist on setting your metrics**, your key performance indicators (KPIs) before that first line of code is written.

### Lecture

Release goals:

- Alpha release - product goes to people who are likely to be friendly
- Beta - product goes to customers who self select themselves in
- General availability - any customer in the world can use your product

Launches can be assesed on two different axes: Reversible vs Irreversible, Small vs Large

Internal launch readiness - use checklists for the following different categories

- product checklist - features work and are bug free
- launch checklist - pricing, packaging & positioning
- service & support readiness
- partner readiness
- operations readiness
- sales & marketing readiness - communications & PR, ads & press campaign

External launch tools - write a blog post about it from the user’s perspective. Examples: [Airbnb](https://news.airbnb.com/update-on-profile-photos/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-organization/)

- summary of what is changing
- tell you how they listen to users to determine the problem
- detailed description of new functionality

Partner with a PMM (prod marketing manager) to create a strong narrative

Go-To market: Strategy on how the product will reach its target customer and achieve competitive advantage.

- Build a market & customer acquisition machine: when you put in $1 you get more than $1 out.
- Company makes more money per user than it spends in acquiring those users in methods that scale to whatever the success criteria are.

Key components of GoTo Market (GTM)

- Your customers
	 - Determines your distribution channels - email, pamphlets, conferences, website, social media etc.
	 - Customers behavior and the channel you market through should mesh.
	 - Channel should uniquely unlock customer growth
- Your Product
	 - Your product can itself serve as a distribution channel - Eg: Hotmail (added a little banner to whoever received an email through Hotmail), Paypal (give everyone $10 in their account to sign up)
	 - Best cases are where there is assymetric value: it is a lot more valuable to the user to get something for free, than it costs the company to give it away.
- Product Economics
	 - Lifetime value (LTV): Total lifetime profit from a single customer
	 - Determines whether you are targeting large volumes (low profit margin) or large levels of customization you can offer (higher profit margin).

	 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): how expensive is it to acquire a customer through a particular channel

	 CAC < LTV - healthy ratio 1:3

	 **Recap**

	 - Understand LTV of your product
	 - Identify best channel fit
	 - Pair customer to best channel fit to scalable & cost effectively acquire those customers

Software is the easiest to distribute, free to replicate (very low distribution costs)

## Module 7: Roadmaps

### Pre-reading

[https://www.intercom.com/blog/where-do-product-roadmaps-come-from/](https://www.intercom.com/blog/where-do-product-roadmaps-come-from/)

There is always more to build than they have resources for. But what distinguishes the great from the good is knowing which ones to build. Deciding what goes on the roadmap and what does not.

[https://review.firstround.com/This-Product-Prioritization-System-Nabbed-Pandora-More-Than-70-Million-Active-Monthly-Users-with-Just-40-Engineers](https://review.firstround.com/This-Product-Prioritization-System-Nabbed-Pandora-More-Than-70-Million-Active-Monthly-Users-with-Just-40-Engineers)

And there's a question you have to ask yourself at the start of every quarter: **What would be stupid for us not to do in the next 90 days?**

Have your team “buy” the ideas they believe are the most valuable to the business by sticking their Post-Its on the corresponding slides. People can choose to spend more than $5 on one idea.

[https://jackiebo.medium.com/how-we-build-our-product-roadmap-at-asana-56953b1e25ad](https://jackiebo.medium.com/how-we-build-our-product-roadmap-at-asana-56953b1e25ad)

![Screen Shot 2022-01-14 at 11.16.54.png](courses/xprod110%20-%20product%20management/attachments/Screen_Shot_2022-01-14_at_11.16.54.png)

[https://www.appcues.com/blog/a-gantt-chart-is-not-a-product-roadmap](https://www.appcues.com/blog/a-gantt-chart-is-not-a-product-roadmap)

A roadmap should communicate more than just deadlines and due dates. It should communicate your product strategy in a way that is clear, efficient, and realistic.

That means providing a holistic view of the *what* and *why*. Focus less on the output, and more on the outcome to highlight progress and goals achieved.

[https://www.prodpad.com/blog/how-to-build-a-product-roadmap-everyone-understands/](https://www.prodpad.com/blog/how-to-build-a-product-roadmap-everyone-understands/)

The litmus test for a good product roadmap template is that it’s **visual**, **accessible** and **clear** enough for anyone to scan for answers to the following questions:

- What are we doing?
- Why are we doing it?
- How does this tie back to our [OKRs](https://www.prodpad.com/features/portfolio-management/objectives-and-key-results/)?

Your roadmap can be the reference point team members use to challenge themselves and one another to link their deliverables back to roadmap goals and OKRs.

The idea behind initiatives is that it’s better to tackle the root of the problem with a single, elegant solution than [burden yourself a growing laundry list of features.](https://www.prodpad.com/2016/01/dont-take-every-feature-request-seriously/)

*Color code and tag them based on themes*

- ****[Janna Bastow - Guide to Roadmapping](https://vimeo.com/100642934?embedded=true&source=video_title&owner=13905167)****
	 - Roadmap: Artifact that communicates the direction you’ll be going to fulfill the product vision
	 - Productization: Impact vs Effort
	 - Take the dates away from the roadmap - conversation should be about where we are heading

*State the shortest or lowest estimate that is reasonable and the largest one and why*

### Lecture

Value to Company: must be very clear & aligned within the organization. revenue or product optimization

Prioritization is most important for roadmaps, most important skill of being a PM

Roadmap: Living document outlining the future of your product

- Communicated your plan to your org on how you deliver value
- what you are working on, why you are working on it & in what order
- plan of record on delivering value

Core tool on doing your job right

- several models/frameworks like kano, stack ranked, matrix etc. but they are just a means to an end so dont get stuck on it.
- your job to convince your team on doing the most impactful things first

Avoid using spreadsheets for your roadmaps.

Use Themes: Major goal from your problem that is aligned to the company (must be grounded in reality/ data)

Themes can be hierarchical from org down to team level. They need to hang off of each other.

Good themes tell a great story: have a sense of purpose

Good themes must be easy to understand

Good themes get everyone coordinated

Good themes serve as design constraints (what it is you are doing and what it is that you are not doing.

What makes a good theme:

- Solving problems
- Measured & targeted outcome
- Prioritize based on data

Prioritization is just another word for convergence

Fermi Estimation: Tool for determining potential impact

- Take a very unstructured problem and try to break it down into constituent parts that can be estimated within an order of magnitude or so. Ex [Drake’s Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation)
- Famous for job interviews (consulting and PM)
- Goal is not to be super precise. Just order of magnitude right is sufficient in PM
- Use logic and data to break down a problem and be ballpark right (back of the envelope calculation)

Estimating cost: how much and how long to build

- Best predictor is understanding implementation of similar projects
- Break down estimates into T-shirt sizes: S (hours,days),M (weeks, months), L (quarters), XL etc.

Prioritization: combination of both data & judgment

- Job is to deliver as much value to company as fast as possible
- Crunch estimates of impact & cost to run the numbers through some math model to prioritize. Then apply judgment.

Set of projects are an investment portfolio

- See how they blend with each other, risk profile etc to balance them well

### Exercise 7.1

![Untitled](courses/xprod110%20-%20product%20management/attachments/Untitled%2018.png)

Themes:

- Learning to not do it again
	 - Intervention reoccurence count over time
- Robot Awareness to ask for help
	 - Number of unplanned interventions over time
- Time to address intervention
	 - Number of seconds and number of clicks to service that intervention

![Untitled](courses/xprod110%20-%20product%20management/attachments/Untitled%2019.png)

- Learning to not do it again
	 - Create simulation scenes from HiFi maps or robot logs - Large
	 - Replicate scenario in Robot school and retrain motion policies - Medium
	 - Update service script to avoid that situation or retrofit the environment to deal with it - Small
- Robot Awareness to ask for help
	 - Train microclassifiers to identify objects from interventions (or novel objects encountered) - Medium
	 - Add classifier for object affordances, eg: the bottle is not upright, there is a spill here - Large
	 - Force torque sensing that detects when an object has dropped something or hit something - Large
- Time to address intervention
	 - Add capability for robot to send videos to Splinter or for remote RO to quickly control pan-tilt head (maybe with pre set motions) - Small
	 - Use large language models to answers simple Yes, no questions - Medium
	 - Stream external building camera footage to remote operator - Medium

*"You look at Google Checkout, you look at PayPal—they get in the way of the product. … In many ways, Google and PayPal are trying to create their own relationship with your customer. I think that's the thing that Stripe has done right. We've designed this for fast use, yes, but also so that you can retain control of your experience, your product, and your customers."*

[https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux](https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux)

What really matters to accelerate a sustainable future is being able to scale up production volume as quickly as possible. That is why Tesla engineering has transitioned to focus heavily on designing the machine that makes the machine -- turning the factory *itself* into a product.

### Lecture

![Untitled](courses/xprod110%20-%20product%20management/attachments/Untitled%2020.png)

Vision: This is the world I want to create in the future

Mission: This is what the company will do to achieve that vision

These two statements need to be very clear

Strategy is synonymous to Roadmap: prioritize, what are the bets you are gonna make in your portfolio to accomplish your mission. A good strategy is the same as having a great roadmap

Good strategy components:

- What do you want to accomplish?
- What pieces do you need?
- How do you sequence the pieces?

Metrics: Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)

- Set an objective: Where do you want to be in 3 months?
- Set Key Results:
	 - They need to measurable (either yes or no answer, or have a number associated with them)
- In order for you to achieve your objective what would need to be true? → This is you “Key Results”
- Create a portfolio of Key Results that helpe you get to your Objective
- OKRs are also hierarchical and nested.

SMART Goals: Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Time-bound

**Get Stuff Done**

- Strong handle on the product lifecycle
- Know you are solving the right problem
- Clear vision and mission statement
- Thoughtful strategy

Only when you are solving the right problem and are bringing the team along.

How do you enable your team?

- Crisp metrics and they know what success looks like
- Unblock them when necessary
- Keep morale high, bring the donuts

How you keep them accountable?

- Set very clear milestones, sprints
- You are quality control

Be the chameleon, diagnose the situation, identify people’s strengths & weaknesses and fill in the gaps.
