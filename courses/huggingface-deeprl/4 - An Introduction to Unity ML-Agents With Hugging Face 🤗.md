Unit 4 is based on [GitHub - Unity-Technologies/ml-agents at main](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/main) : this is an equivalent of OpenAI or Atari gym it seems.

## Highlights
- the classical one (curiosity through next-state prediction) was to calculate curiosity **as the error of our agent of predicting the next state, given the current state and action taken.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc4b9t27f6s5kbj04vfh1tt))
	 - Note: This seems very much like learning the transition model in model-free RL
