# Module 2: Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning, and Marketing Opportunities

## Segmentation

![[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/xprod154 - product marketing 22.png]]

![[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/xprod154 - product marketing 21.png]]

Segmentation is Critical

>
> "If you’re not thinking segments, you’re not thinking. To think segments means you have to think about the choices that are or might be available to them" - Ted Levitt
>

As a marketer you are an applied social scientist. You are trying to figure out how to affect people's behavior

### Good Segmentation: Lids

Large - Segments must be large enough for you to care about building products for
Identifiable - It should be easy to say who belongs to which segment
Distinctive
		![[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/xprod154 - product marketing 20.png]]
Stable - You should know when people would move from 1 segment to another

### Types of Segmentation

Demographic - gender etc is a common factor
A pet company once segmented by asking the question: "Does you dog sleep on your bed"

A gig problem with product line segmentation like expensive, mid-range, cheap can be cannibalization. Someone might eat the market share of the more expensive brand because there is a cheaper alternative. Therefore it is important to make it distinctive enough such that they dont compete with each other.

## Targeting

![[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/xprod154 - product marketing 16.png]]

Rookie mistake in product marketing is to think you know the kind of product that your target market wants

### Positioning
> [!quote]
>Positioning is not what you do to a product. Positioning is what you do to the mind of the prospect. That is, you position (place) the product in the mind of the prospect - Jack Trout & Al Ries

![[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/xprod154 - product marketing 15.png]]

**Amazon's positioning statement from 2000** : For World Wide Web users who enjoy books, Amazon.com is a retail bookseller that provides instant access to over 1.1 million books. Unlike traditional book retailers, Amazon.com provides a combination of extraordinary convenience, low prices, and comprehensive selection.

![[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/xprod154 - product marketing 14.png]]

Examples of Vertical Positioning:

- Orange juice - no pulp, some pulp, lots of pulp
- iPhone - mini, max, pro
- razor blade - 1 blade, 2 blade, 3 blades etc

Examples of Horizontal Positioning:

- Uber (convenience, transactional) vs Lyft (friendly, chatty driver)

![[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/xprod154 - product marketing 13.png]]

Developing Positioning Strategy

- Which positions are of greatest value to our target customers, given their needs?
- Which of these positions are “taken,” and which positions are relatively free of competition?
- Which of the available positions fits best with our objectives and our distinctive capabilities, i.e., can we back up the chosen positioning by demonstrable product attributes or benefits?
- Can we “change the rules” of the game by discovering new critical points of differentiation?
- Are all our positioning messages consistent?

#### Starbucks case Study

[[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/Starbucks- Delivering customer service.pdf]]
They had the OG customers from 1992 who wanted the intimate hangout experience while the newer gen 2002 customers wanted a more quick, drive thru like experience of grabbing coffee on the way to work

When you stopped segmenting customers you stop realizing that there are different preferences that people have in terms of their need for your product

### Module 3: Source of Value

#### Functional Value

What kind of features & functions does this have

#### Economic Value

How much does the product cost and how much does it save us in the long run
Total lifecycle savings from new product compared with old product
Economic value is all relative to what else is there in the market that people or the user pay for already
Economic value can sometimes be overridden by emotional value that the customer derives

#### Psychological Value

How it makes them feel
Brand is a promise that a firm makes to its customers
Brands usually mean money - they earn more than industry average because people associate certain feelings with them

Building Brand Equity : Response to a product due to brand name over and above other aspects of the product offering
![[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/xprod154 - product marketing 12.png]]
Cold - means in our head
Hot - feelings, things that are in our stomach

Things that you are familiar with - you are more likely to like
Retrieving some examples in your head might inhibit you to retrieve other examples

Puma shoes built a brand around how quirky the animal Pumas are. They are solo, they are different etc. Puma brand then went and partnered and created a product strategy around those quirks

Resonance: Brand Communities
SHARED CONSCIOUSNESS Members feel they sort of know each other
	Who else drives Broncos: Guys like myself and guys who like engines.
RITUALS AND TRADITIONS Way in which meaning of community is reproduced
	If you drove a Saab, whenever you passed someone else driving a Saab on the road, you beeped or flashed your lights.
SENSE OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY Sense of duty to community as a whole
	We see another Saab on the road , we pull over and help, no matter what it is

![[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/xprod154 - product marketing 11.png]]

The trouble with brand equity is that it has no consistent meaning…. Hard to measure!

ACCORD framework for how to increase product adoption and make them succeed

- Advantage
	- has to have some kind of relative benefit wrt its competition
- Compatibility
	- should be compatible with other products that you already use
- Complexity
	- people dont like complex - minimize it, make it easy to use
- Observability
	- when you observe other people use it
- Risk
	- for eg: if you think the company may or may not be around
- Divisibility
	- easier to get adopted when you can buy small elements one at a time rather than a full system altogether

Taking the time to apply the ACCORD framework to a product can be immensely helpful in understanding when a product is more likely to be adopted. The “advantage” outlines whether or not the product has a significant benefit relative to the competition. A product is also more likely to be adopted when it is “compatible” with the technology you have or are already engaged in. Products that are more “complex” are products that are less likely to be adopted, so complexity should be minimized. Products are also more likely to catch on if other people can see you using them, and the “observability” is higher. “Risk” should also be as low as possible, because most people do not prefer products that they perceive to be risky. And finally, “divisibility,” which is when products are more likely to be adopted when instead of buying a whole new system, a consumer can buy small elements of it one at a time.

### Module 4: New Product Strategy &THE Bugaboo case

#### Ideation Templates

Research shows that adding restrictions makes people more creative. There templates are better than a blank sheet of paper when brainstorming ideas.

##### Subtraction Templates

Snap, Twitter, Path, Tiktok etc are just Facebook but with restrictions.
They have subtracted some feature/s out of Facebook and now they serve a specific market of their own
Other examples:
	Laceless shows by Converse,
	iPod shuffle - which is an ipod without a screen, so it adds an element of surprise when you dont know what song will come next

> [!quote]
> Perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away.
> 	- Antoine de Saint-Exupery

Steps to follow **Subtraction Template**:

1. Write down the product’s internal components (i.e., components within the manufacturer’s control)
2. Identify each component’s function in the product
3. Remove (or reduce) a component
4. Visualize the resulting product
5. Search for any consumer needs that match the new product

##### Task Unification Template

Two purposes/function for a single task - create a product that unifies 2 or more functions into one.

![[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/xprod154 - product marketing 10.png]]

Duraflame - has wooden log & lighter fluid

![[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/xprod154 - product marketing 9.png]] ![[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/xprod154 - product marketing 8.png]]

Task Unification Instructions:

1. Write down the product’s internal components (i.e., components within the manufacturer’s control)
2. Identify each component’s function in the product
3. Write down the product’s external components (i.e., components of the product’s environment / packaging)
4. Could one of the functions currently fulfilled by an internal component be transferred to an external component?
	Can we remove the now obsolete internal component?
5. Could one of the functions currently fulfilled by an external component be transferred to an internal component?
6. What new, desirable functions could be fulfilled by the external components?

![[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/xprod154 - product marketing 7.png|700]]

##### Division Template

Separating Components:
Physical: Literally, cut it
	Eg: this play mat ![[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/xprod154 - product marketing 6.png]]
Functional: separate components with different functions
	Eg: car stereos witha removable face plate to prevent theft ![[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/xprod154 - product marketing 5.png]]
Preserving: each part preserves characteristic of the whole

Another good example from the exercise could be hiking pants that are convertible to shorts or removable hoods in hoodies:
![[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/xprod154 - product marketing 4.png|800]]

**Division Template Instructions:**

1. Write down the product’s components
2. Identify each component’s function in the product
3. Divide the product into its component parts
4. Visualize the resulting product
5. Search for any consumer needs that match the new product

##### Multiplication Template

Examples: garbage can that has both trash & recyclable; multiple blades at different angles in a razor; multiple toilet seats for each member in the family.
**Multiplication Template Instructions:**

1. Write down the product’s components
2. Identify each component’s function in the product
3. Multiply one of the components
4. Visualize the resulting product
5. Search for any consumer needs that match the new product

##### Attribute Dependency Template

Creating or changing relationship between attributes
	Sometimes involves adding relationship, sometimes subtracting (related to subtraction)

Egs:

- Color of Coors beer and the temperature of it
- Gym fees based on how often you go - more means cheaper & less means more expensive

![[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/xprod154 - product marketing 3.png]]
![[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/xprod154 - product marketing 2.png]]

Reminds me of a bit like IFTTT or Apple Shortcuts -> IF something in external attribute is detected THEN do something about Internal Attribute.
This of course is more on the SW end but think of similar framework within the physical world as well. Color changing formulas, Odor in natural gas for leak detection etc.

**Attribute Dependency Instructions**

1. Write down the product’s internal attributes (attributes under the manufacturer’s control)
2. Identify a set of external attributes (outside the manufacturer’s control but in direct contact with product)
3. Construct a Forecasting Matrix:
	- Columns - internal attributes
	- Rowsboth internal and external attributes
4. Explore dependencies between pairs of attributes

#### Bugaboo case Study

[[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/Bugaboo Case Study.pdf]]
![[courses/xprod154 - product marketing/attachments/xprod154 - product marketing 1.png]]

FOUR POTENTIAL DRIVERS OF GROWTH
Customer-Driven
	What do our current or future customers want? (e.g., double-stroller)
Expertise-Driven
	What do we do best? (e.g., Bugaboo thinks it’s expertise is innovation in mobility)
Product-Category
	Expand product line, accessories
Distribution-Driven
	Grow by increasing distribution of current products

If the new Bugaboo product you created fits in the same product, same market category, then you most likely didn’t stray very far from the original product, and developed a new kind of stroller. Something like a baby walker would be a new product in the same market. Same product and new market on the chart is largely about distribution channels, which is not being discussed in depth since a new product is being developed. A product like luggage would be a new product with a new market.
There are certainly advantages and disadvantages to pursuing a growth strategy in each of the boxes. Same product and the same market create a lot of advantages. Bugaboo already makes a similar product, they have established sales channels, and they have been successful in this area before. However, a disadvantage of creating a similar product in the same market is that this strategy will further entrench Bugaboo as a stroller company, rather than branching out. If Bugaboo creates a new product in the same market, then this takes advantage of the fact that Bugaboo is already available in baby stores, and selling product extensions in those stores could happen fairly easily and leverage their sales channels. However, this strategy does not align with the goal of making Bugaboo a mobility company over a stroller company. A new product in a new market would be an entirely new avenue to explore and it can offer way more opportunity.

### Module Summary
- Need to understand who your customers are - what are their wants and where your competitors might be lacking in meeting their needs
	- UNDERSTAND YOUR CUSTOMERS NEEDS
- Sources of value for a product:
	- Functional - what it does
	- Economical - how much money it saves them
	- Psychological (very important, more art than science) - how it makes them feel
- Structure motivates creative output - creativity with restrictions
	- Hard to fill a blank space with content
