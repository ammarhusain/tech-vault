# 1 - User Research Methods

**TL;dr** User research : Engaging with users to understand their point of view

User research can help you...

- Gain empathy for your customer
- Understand customerʼs current behaviors, motivations and needs
- Gain insight into whatʼs broken about current experiences
- Generate new innovative ideas you might not have considered
- Validate assumptions
- Discover how customers engage with your product in the real world
- Understand why things are happening
- Distinguish what customers say they are doing from what they are actually doing

What user research canʼt do

- Tell you exactly what to design
- Come up with new ideas for you
- Make decisions for you
- Predict the future

Be the biggest advocate of user research

## Wide Range of Methods
- Usability testing, Unmoderated user testing
- Rapid experimentation
- Interviews, Contextual inquiry
- Analytics & A/B testing
- Surveys

Methods have key attributes
Generative: New idea generation
vs Evaluative: Evaluating ideas and designs

Qualitative: Small sample size, deep insight, exploration
vs Quantitative: Large sample size, measurable, semi-objective insight

Behavioral: Observe what people do
vs Attitudinal: Listen to what people say

Levels of structure

- Semi-structured : Semi-structured interviews ; Moderating usability testing ; Participatory design ; Focus groups
- Experientially structured : Contextual inquiry / Needfinding ; Rapid experimentation ; Diary studies
- Very structured : Unmoderated usability testing ; Card sorting ; Surveys (online and via structured interviews) ; Analytics and A/B Testing ; Eye tracking ; Message board mining ; Focus groups

## Key Methods

### Rapid Experimentation

Creating an experience using off the shelf pieces to observe how people would actually engage with your idea
**Attributes :**
Qualitative ; Evaluative and generative ; Behavioral ; Experientially structured ; In-person or remote ; Moderated and unmoderated ; Pre-recruited or guerrilla

### Moderated Usability Testing

Gathering feedback on design ideas by asking a user to imagine themselves in certain predefined scenarios facilitated by a moderator
**Attributes :**
Qualitative ; Evaluative (mostly) ; Attitudinal and behavioral ; Semi-structured (depending on condition of prototype) ; In-person or remote ; Moderated ; Pre-recruited or Guerrilla

### Unmoderated Testing

Gathering feedback on design ideas by providing specific tasks for users facilitated by user testing software
**Attributes :**
Qualitative or Quantitative ; Evaluative ; Behavioral and attitudinal ; Very structured ; Remote ; Unmoderated ; Pre-recruited

### Focus Groups

Great for understanding groups. But they can yield to echo chambers as one or two people might dominate & sway the opinion of the group.

### Online Surveys

A structured questionnaire to understand and identify possible problem spots and high level attitudes OR validate assumptions with a large sample size
**Attributes :**
Quantitative ; Evaluative ; Attitudinal ; Very structured ; Remote ; Unmoderated ; Pre-recruited or guerrilla

Some times data might not be reliable. People try to go through quickly. Lack nuance and specificity; people are poor reporters.

## Product Development Process

### Research Goals at Different Stages

**Evaluate Opportunity :** Understand the market, assess match between the idea and user needs, determine what is relevant for users, refine requirements
**Design Solution :** Evaluate designs, decide between different ideas
**Build and Ship :** Refine final design, make sure there are no surprises at launch
**Measure :** Evaluate acceptance, prepare for next version, find new problem areas, identify trends
