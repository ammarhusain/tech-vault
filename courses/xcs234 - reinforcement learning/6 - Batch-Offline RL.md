Data Is Censored in that Only Observe Outcomes for Decisions Made

Why Canâ€™t We Just Use Q-Learning?
	Q-learning is an off policy RL algorithm
		Can be used with data different than the state--action pairs would visit under the optimal Q state action values
	But deadly triad (Sutton & Barto) of bootstrapping, function approximation and off policy, and can fail
