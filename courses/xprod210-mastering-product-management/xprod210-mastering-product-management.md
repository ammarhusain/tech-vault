- spotlights customer needs
- Underlying “Why” you are in business

![Untitled](courses/xprod210-mastering-product-management/attachments/Untitled.png)

**Vision**

- Reflects the “where” that you are headed: north star, unifying focal point for everyone
- Big, hairy, audacious goal (BHAG)
- Future casting, motivating and purpose driven - inspiring & engaging
- Builds on core competencies

![Untitled](courses/xprod210-mastering-product-management/attachments/Untitled%201.png)

**Core values**

- Helps the company determine the “how” of what they’re doing
- Enduring, passionate and distinctive beliefs
- Reputation for traits such as: : Leadership, Product innovation, total customer satisfaction

### Value Proposition

Value Proposition dimensions:

- Functional: Make a product work better
- Economic: Make a product be cheaper
- Psychological: Make a product make people feel better

Comes from an observation of the market. Products that are valuable are products that fill gaps

Start with the customer/problem

## Module 3: Product Strategy

### 3.2 Translating Company Strategy to Product Strategy

Strategy: A set of activities designed to achieve an objective

To have a strategy you need to have an objective

You must first start with a company strategy to set the objectives

![Untitled](courses/xprod210-mastering-product-management/attachments/Untitled%202.png)

Come up with a list of decomposition ideas that are Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive (MECE)

Create a list of Focus Areas

Impact Thesis: Write a short thesis for how each focus area/bucket might impact the company goals

- Improving performance might impact customer happiness
- Improving onboarding will improve revenue

Don’t say what will or will not work just yet. Instead focus on creating a list of candidate target areas. Then create these thesis statements as hypothesis to estimate impact of each target area.

Product strategy output: A few key initiatives & clear explanations of why they will help achieve the company strategy and guardrails for accomplishing these goals.

### 3.3 Prioritizing Product Initiatives

Levers and Prioritization:

Find low hanging fruit with highest impact. Use qualitative and quantitative evidence and judgement to prioritize the most important areas

Analogous to building Roadmaps: Company objectives → Product strategy

Look at the Product holistically rather than just the hardware or software. It is the set of all interactions (experiences) that the customer has with the product.

- Should look at HiTL as a product that sums all interactions be it onsite, remote, learning pipeline etc.

Take a broad, cross-functional approach to these groupings and problems

For each item in the company strategy, turn it into 3-5 bullets in product strategy that cover your focus areas

Top, Down estimation: Using external data (benchmark or best in class, industry standard, common sense etc) to estimate might be possible relative to where you are today.

- Useful in deciding if that area is worth investing in
- It is a quick way of understanding whether you are best in class on a particular dimension or not

Bottom, Up: Pick a set of projects. Use Fermi estimation and Funnel analysis to estimate their impact

Start with Top,Down estimate to eliminate a few product initiatives. Then do Bottom,Up estimation on the remaining initiatives

### 3.4 Organizational Structure

Determines the reporting structure and how decisions get made.

Functional Org structure: Create divisions based on discipline/skillsets. All engs → Eng Manager → Director of Eng → VP of Eng

![Untitled](courses/xprod210-mastering-product-management/attachments/Untitled%203.png)

- Results in specialization & redundancy. Affords the staff better mentorship & feedback.
- Doesn’t encode anything about company strategy. Coordination costs are high. Diffuses responsibility & clear ownership

Product Org structure: Cross functional and rallies around a product/business line

![Untitled](courses/xprod210-mastering-product-management/attachments/Untitled%204.png)

- Act quickly & autonomously with lower coordination overhead
- Aligns the org structure with the customer from a quality & experience POV
- Encourages employees to think holistically
- Different products can unintentionally compete. Managers may be less experienced with the disciplines within their org.

Matrix Org: Combines functional & product org structure. Most modern SW companies operate this way.

- Usually a Director of Product, SW & HW might work together towards a product line even though they lead their own team of product, SW or HW experts.
- At some altitude (usually Director or VP) level the org gets hybridized.

![Untitled](courses/xprod210-mastering-product-management/attachments/Untitled%205.png)

Make sure to directly map Product Initiatives to your Org structure

Team size roughly reflects priority inside of an org. Senior product leaders make fewer feature level tradeoffs and more staffing decisions.

### 3.5 Creating a Roadmap

Roadmap is where the rubber meets the road for individual contributor [[career/management|PMs]]. Primary tool for driving results

Product strategy is a pre-requisite for building a great roadmap just like Company Objectives are a pre-requisite for building a product strategy

A Roadmap is an execution plan for a product strategy. The product strategy outlines what you want to accomplish. The roadmap details how you will accomplish it and when.

Roadmap: Living document that communicates a prioritized list of projects to achieve the product strategy

Think of a roadmap as a container of projects of different sizes

PM Primary skill: Be an excellent writer! Clearly lists the projects and their priority order. Provides written context on why

Product strategy will provide clear direction about both what to accomplish and broadly how to accomplish it

Roadmap is where we make the jump from guardrails (product strategy) to an actual list of projects

Again use Decomposition:

![Untitled](courses/xprod210-mastering-product-management/attachments/Untitled%206.png)

Roadmapping process:

- Company strategy → Product strategy initiatives (decomposition) → List of projects (decomposition) → Prioritized list (Top,Down & Bottom, Up estimation)

	 ![Untitled](courses/xprod210-mastering-product-management/attachments/Untitled%207.png)

S-curve phases:

![Untitled](courses/xprod210-mastering-product-management/attachments/Untitled%208.png)

- Creating value: Product delivers value far in excess of its price point
- Extracting value: Price changes, packing changes, contracts etc to get \$\$\$ out

Economically efficient: You don’t want to spend a dollar to make 80 cents. Ballpark ratio is 3-1 where you should get 3x the lifetime value from a customer to the cost you spend to acquire that customer.

## Module 4: Feature Strategy

### 4.1 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Why, What and How

3 parts:

- Problem alignment
	 - Background
	 - Problem statement
	 - High level approach
	 - Goals & non-goals
	 - Assumptions
- Solution alignment
	 - Features & Scope
	 - Key Flows
	 - Open issues & key decisions
	 - Risks & mitigations
- Launch Readiness
	 - Milestones
	 - Stakeholder checklist
	 - Launch checklist

Your job as a PM is to really get the problem space right before moving to the solution space. And to cover the solution space exhaustively before trying to build.

**Problem Alignment**

- Background
	 - Describe how this particular feature fits into the overall product. Describe your customer and what makes them unique and worth building for. 3-4 statements
- Problem statement
	 - Describe problem to solve in 1-2 statements. Describe why this matters and may be list some evidence pointing to it.

	 ![Untitled](courses/xprod210-mastering-product-management/attachments/Untitled%209.png)

- High Level Approach
	 - Use words to describe how this looks like today and what the world would look like once this product has been built. (or visuals)
	 - Should quickly give readers a sense of scope. They should be able to squint their eyes and get a sense of the product
- Goals & non-goals
	 - What does success look like? And Failure?
	 - Should include measurable goals ([[metrics]]) and non measurable goals (think, feel etc)
	 - Listing non goals is as important
- Assumptions
	 - List out assumption you are making about your user, their problems & your approach

**Solution Alignment**

- Features & Scope
	 - Overview of what you are building. How big of a project is this? Prioritized list of features. Describe your key features
	 - Rollout & testing plan. Whats included in v1, v2 etc
- Key Flow
	 - Show mocks
- Open issues & key decision
	 - Gather open questions and document when decisions are made
- Risks & mitigation

**Launch Readiness**

Highlights risks & dependencies

- Key milestones
	 - Internal pilot, beta pilot, public launch etc
- Stakeholder checklist
	 - Make a go-to market plan
	 - Log the right data, logging, privacy security etc
	 - Build teams who ultimately touch your user
- Launch checklist
	 - Rollout plan : For everyone vs gradual
	 - Eng: Bug backlog? How are you monitoring logs?

### 4.2 Driving Adoption and Customer Preferences

Product must provide discernible advantage

Simplicity, Compatibility, see the social consumption (make it observable), what matters is how we perceive it (mitigate perceived risk)

Products live in the mind of the customer

- Products come to mean, come to function, come to have associations that the consumers choose

Social scientists study what drives peoples’ behaviors

### 4.3 Airbnb case Study

Nothing super duper interesting.

## Module 5: Execution

Four core components of being a PM:

- Take an individual idea from start to finish - Product Lifecycle

	 ![Untitled](courses/xprod210-mastering-product-management/attachments/Untitled%2010.png)

- Roadmap: Build a portfolio of products
- Vision & strategy for the company, product and/or feature
- Execution: New PM more time on execution vs senior PM is more on strategy. This is a stepping stone and the core component

	 ![Untitled](courses/xprod210-mastering-product-management/attachments/Untitled%2011.png)

	 Mid-[[career/career]] PM: Play a balancing role between Leader & Contributor. Work in the solution space while also keep your focus on the problem space

	 Project management is an easy trap to fall into (its not the whole job). Some people spend too much time in execution and not enough on problem definition & strategy

	 Dont spend all your time on project management since it will always be a fire. It is just a prerequisite

	 Agile & waterfall are the two ways of execution

	 - [ ] Look them up ^^

### 5.2 Roles & Responsibilities

Organizational roles:

- [[career/management|Product Managers]] are mostly focussed on **who** we are solving the problem for and **why** it is important
- Design is focussed on **how** we should solve a problem.
	- [[career/management|PMs]] usually give design a clear problem definition and they figure out the best way to solve it. UI vs UX design
	- Clearly figure out the problem you are trying to solve before pairing up with the designers
	- Design is downstream of product on most projects
- Engineering - actually build stuff. Go for requirements & spec to code
	- IC - light on meetings & long blocks of productive time
	- Eng Manager - people manager ([[career/career]] dev, leveling up skills, hire & retain etc.)
	- Tech Lead - How projects are implemented and executed. Translating requirements into reality. Details, dates & timelines

	TLs are usually informal vs Eng Manager are officially recognized in the org.

Roles within the Product Lifecycle

- Evaluate Opportunity : primarily owned by PM
	- Talking to customers, Understanding requirements, Market size

	![Untitled](courses/xprod210-mastering-product-management/attachments/Untitled%2012.png)

- Design Solution: primarily owned by design

	![Untitled](courses/xprod210-mastering-product-management/attachments/Untitled%2013.png)

- Build: primarily owned by TLs

	![Untitled](courses/xprod210-mastering-product-management/attachments/Untitled%2014.png)

- Ship (PM or PMM) , Measure (PM through [[metrics]]), Iterate (PM)

Create a PRD and then work with a designer on how to solve the problem

### 5.3 Operational Cycles

Cycle: repeated cadence that a company uses for planning & execution

Strategy cycle: Led by CEO & exec team, usually once a year

Objective & Key Results (OKR) cycle: Set clearly defined goals and 305 key results used to measure progress.

Created by decomposing the company strategy & objectives

Operation cycle: Team level cadence (2-4 weeks). Usually led by PM, TL &/ EM. Smallest unit of doing work. Commonly Sprints

- Agile, Scrum, Waterfall, Kanban
- Agile: Highly iterative that focuses on defining work in short intervals and rigorous tracking work velocity
- Waterfall: Planning heavy process that maps out every stage of a product & dependencies

Need to balance between 2 axes: Planning vs Doing and Commitment vs Flexibility

![Untitled](courses/xprod210-mastering-product-management/attachments/Untitled%2015.png)

**Kickoff:**

- Key partnership moment between PM and EM/TL
- PM sets the focus on context and prioritization. Eng Mgr takes that and works on staffing individual tasks
- Often helpful to align with your TL in a pre meeting so there are no surprises during the kickoff and you both are on the same page.

**Check-in**

- Daily 10 min standup
- What they got done; what they plan on doing; status; blockers

**Execution**

- Be very responsive; make yourself available if anyone needs
- Write things down
- Get into the details. Make the engineers self sufficient but they should be able to pull you in if needed and enjoy working with you

**Retrospective**

- What went well and what didn’t go well
- Blameless postmortem

Focus on perfecting the craft of running sprints with every new one. If you gain mastery of running this early on you will gain huge mastery working your way through the PM [[career/career]] ladder.

### 5.4 Cross-functional Collaboration & Culture

Collaborating with designers & engineers - 3 components

- Bring designers & engineers to the table early
	- make sure they are doing their [[courses/xprod115 - user research/xprod115 - user research|user research]] early, work with them to explore the problem & solution space
- Leverage their expertise
	- Your key flows in the PRD should link to the ones the designers create
	- Eng needs to write the corresponding Tech Spec to your PRD
- Remember your complimentary role to each of them

5 things to build an amazing culture

- Celebrate wins together
- Acknowledge good work
- Foster effective communication
- Learn from your mistakes
- Cultivate a culture of appreciation

### 5.5 Connecting Operational Cadence with Roadmap

4 main areas for a [[career/management|product manager]]:

- Product Lifecycle
- Roadmap
- Team Strategy
- Execution

Roadmap is a living document of prioritized list of themes & projects - usually owned by the [[career/management|Product Manager]]

Sprint plan - Execution plan of who will do what work by when

Roadmap feeds into the sprint plan but is not the same

[[career/management|Product Manager]] goal:

- make sure priority is clear
- make sure projects for engineers are ready to go

Avoid making changes during a sprint. Sprints should be short and commited blocks of time

[[career/management|PMs]] should be thinking ahead to the next set of sprints (at least 2-3 sprints out)

Have a set of small projects (little rocks) ready to go to fill in

## Module 6: Product Growth

How do I communicate the benefit I’ve created to the world.

Firstly you should know - what problems your product is solving and for whom. Then figure out:

- Where does the target audience obtain their information?
- Where would be the most natural outlet for them to obtain information about what I am offering?
- What do they need to know in order to be able to make their decision on whether to purchase your product?

A successful PM is also a successful social scientist - run experiments that reduces uncertainty and aids in decision making

Customer Retention:

- Why are they paying me? How do I make them keep coming back?
