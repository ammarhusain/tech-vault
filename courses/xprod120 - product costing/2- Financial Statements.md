Fundamental Accounting Principles and Concepts

- The Entity Concept – The accounting unit is the business, separate from its shareholders and owners. Ie everything in the financial statements should reflect decisions made by the CEO & everyone below and not factor in other decision makers.
- The Cost Principle – All assets are recorded at their cost to the business, with cost being the amount of cash or other consideration given to obtain the items, at the date of purchase.
- Stable Dollar Assumption – Changes in the value of currency are ignored.
- Reliability Concept – Information regarding accounting transactions is objective.
- Relevance Concept – Information regarding accounting transactions is relevant.

Often the OKRs or SMART goals set for senior executives (like the CEO) by the board is to boost the Earnings Per Share (EPS) of the company.
