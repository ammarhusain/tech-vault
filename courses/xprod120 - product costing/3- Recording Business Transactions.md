Business decisions are classified into three major groups:

- Operating activities – ultimately provide goods and services to customers or users
- Investing activities – transactions that create the long-term tangible and intangible assets needed to run the firm
- Financing activities – determine where the money will be sourced to operate the business and provide money for investing activities Accounting systems only track accounting transactions that alter assets, liabilities, and shareholders’ equity of the business, and its balance sheet.

# Accrual Accounting

Handles the case where you might sign a deal that will get completed say in March 2023 which is when you get paid by the customer (revenue). However the costs associated with completing that deals (expenses: salaries, operating costs etc) are incurred right away, say Oct 2022. At the year end financial statement for Dec 31,2022 it might look like the company is not very profitable because it is spending a bunch of money while the revenue has not been booked yet. How do you handle balancing out these arbitrary checkpoints?

Companies use Reporting Interval Concept to define when & how often the firm will report on its activities.

Once the revenues for a specific reporting period have been identified, all of the resources and expenses associated with that revenue are recorded during that same reporting period.

Annual Accounting Cycle

1. Analyze transactions and events and record all necessary journal entries
2. Post the journal entries into T-accounts
3. Prepare the “trial balance”
4. Prepare the adjusting journal entries and post them to T-accounts
5. Prepare the adjusted trial balance
6. Prepare the financial statements from the adjusted trial balance
7. Close the temporary accounts

Accrual-based accounting is required by GAAP/IFRS.
There is the concept of Recognized Revenue and Deferred Revenue.
