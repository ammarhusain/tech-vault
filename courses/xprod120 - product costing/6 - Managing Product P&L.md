Individuals form organizations to achieve some common goals

Managers, including [[career/management|product managers]], add value to the organization and generate profit by making good decisions

- Actively managing the product P&L via budgeting, taking actions, and evaluating performance
- Selecting a production process or supplier based on cost information that indicates a cheaper option

Identifying and eliminating nonvalue-added activities

- Maximizing customer LTV

Understanding financials statements and accounting helps [[career/management|PMs]] manage the long term value of a customer which is the primary goal/target.
[[career/management|Product Manager]] usually make a lot of operations decisions. Not as many financing or investing decisions (not as relevant at the product level).

Period costs are the continuous running costs and billed as they go.
Product costs are booked when the product is sold.
Senior managers like to map Period costs to Product costs to get a sense of how much resources a product line is consuming, for ex: number of accountants working on it, cost of leasing real estate etc.
There is no real clear formula on mapping period costs to product costs so companies create their own guidelines and follow them diligently.

# Cost Allocation

 How do shared resources get split among various product lines.

- Cost Object – any end to which a cost is assigned (e.g., a unit of product or service, a department, or a customer)
- Cost Pool – the cost we want to assign to the cost objects (e.g., department costs, rental costs, travel costs to multiple clients)
- Cost Allocation Rule – method or process use to assign the costs in the cost pool to the cost object

As a PM you should be aware of your Cost Objects, Cost Pools and the Cost Allocation Rule your firm follows. This will guide you on how your product P&L is being computed and advocate accordingly.

# Cost Behavior
- **Variable costs** are those that change in direct proportion to the volume of activity
- **Fixed costs** are those that remain unchanged as the volume of activity changes
- **Semi-variable costs** are those with both fixed and variable components
- **Step costs**, or semi-fixed costs, increase with volume in “steps.”

Cost relations are only relevant over a certain range of activity.
