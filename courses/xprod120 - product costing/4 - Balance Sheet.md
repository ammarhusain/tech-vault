# Current Assets

It has measurable future value to the firm as a result of past transactions
Product managers would most often be interested in the Inventories line item of Current Assets

- When inventory is sold, the expense associated with that inventory is referred to as “cost of goods sold”, or (COGS).
- When COGS is deducted from sale revenue, it provides the most elementary measure of profit, called “gross profit”, or “gross margin.”
- LTV (lifetime value) of a customer = profit x visits
- There are two main types of inventory
	- Merchandise inventory
	- Manufacturing Inventory

Most common inventory systems these days are Perpetual (keeps track of all the parts that went into manufacturing the product with QR codes etc)
Other method is Periodic - less common these days given digitization (average cost flow, FIFO or LIFO cost flows)

Seems like a lot of companies (Apple, Intel, Home Depot etc) use FIFO as their accounting method for Inventories (Form 10-K filed with SEC)
[Apple 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019322000108/aapl-20220924.htm#ief5efb7a728d4285b6b4af1e880101bc_85)

# Long Term Assets

Long-term tangible assets (machinery, equipment, buildings, computers) represent future benefits that will eventually be used in the course of business.

- The cost of any long-term tangible asset (except for land), less its expected salvage value, is expensed over the expected useful life of the asset.
	- Depreciation

The value of intangible assets stems from ownership rights rather than from their physical form.

- Identifiable intangibles
- Unidentifiable intangibles (Goodwill)

Identifiable intangibles

- Patents
- Copyrights
- Trademarks and Brand Names
- Franchises and Licenses

Goodwill is the net unrecorded assets obtained when one entity purchases another entity.

# Liabilities & Shareholders' Equity
- **Liabilities**: future transfer of assets to other parties by the business
- **Shareholder equity**: how much do the owners own in the company. total of the owners interests in the assets of the business.

Working capital = current assets - current liabilities
Current liabilities usually contains:

- short term debt - loans that need to be repayed < 1year
- account payable - money owed to suppliers
- accruent comp & benefits - wages etc to employees
- etc etc

Shareholders equity is usually divided into two parts:

- contributed capital - capital provided by shareholders when they purchase newly issued stock in the company (common or preferred stock).
- earned capital - like the companies savings account. everything that is not returned to the stockholders as dividends is added to the earned / retained capital column.
