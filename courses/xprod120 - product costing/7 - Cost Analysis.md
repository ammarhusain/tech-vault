Low operating leverage companies has very low fixed costs so they are less affected by economic downturns. Where as high leverage companies have a lot invested in infrastructure, equipment etc that it costs them less to bump production (aka variable costs) but are more vulnerable with lower margin of safety.
Margin of Safety = Sales Volume â€“ Break Even Sales Value

[[career/management|Product Managers]] dont set the market price but they do set the price at which they are willing to enter with this product into the market.

The Full Cost Fallacy: Assuming all costs are variable costs

Long Term pricing based on cost:

- Cost-plus Approach - take the cost plus some markup (usually great for government work)
- Full Cost Approach - take the full absorption cost plus gross profit
- Life Cycle Product Costing and Pricing - this is used for products that need a lot of R&D or have costs associated way after launch like car batteries or electronics (disposal)
- Target Costing from Target Pricing - work backward from a target price that the market is willing to pay for your product and figure out what costs to incur.

Determining what costs & prices to offer without affect your P&L too much is a big part of the [[career/management|product managers]] job.
