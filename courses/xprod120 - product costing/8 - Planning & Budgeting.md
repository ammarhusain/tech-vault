Let’s return to the Apple’s Form 10-K that you found previously.

What is your estimate or target for next year’s revenue from iPhone, Mac, iPad, Wearables, Home and Accessories, and Services? How did you come up with this estimate or target?

my estimates for next year 2023 are (in millions of $):
iPhone - 210k
Mac - 44k
iPad - 32k
Wearables, Home and Accessories - 44k
Services - 90k
estimate for net income - 110k
