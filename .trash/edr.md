# Meditations
- [[2022-11-17-Thursday]] #journal/meditations
	- EDR as a team over scopes the simple problems and under scopes the really complex ones
		- Like should we have a button on the visualizer. While no one really knows the what the autonomous system is really supposed to do and to what performance levels.

## [[2020-11-19-Thursday]] Wfov Thoughts

Not sure how its possible to stay dispassionate about it after burning 6 months of work on a poorly defined workstream.

- It is interesting on what discussion triggered this "dispassionate assessment"... a simple image downsampling operation :S Is image downsampling really that contentious??
- Michael & I have assumed that the WFOV cam is here to stay and have been working under that assumption throughout.
- We have been trying to bring up a new use case (semantics in nav) by trying to leverage this new sensor in parallel. Essentially layout all the ground work (model batching, sim datagen, automatic annotation pipeline etc etc)
- I could have made progress on my original goal (semantics in nav) by just using the NFOV and would have gone a lot further by just working on panoptic shapemask + HiFi map semantics. Instead burned all the time on auxiliary tasks
- It was never made clear that we need to make a case for why we WFOV or prove its worth. If that was the case why have the entire WFOV SW bringup package that outlines all the plumbing & pipeline. Why not define a WP outlining the analysis/experiment focused on WFOV value add.
- This was not a scientific or technological failure but a breakdown of expectations and communications.
- Forrest, Oliver, Eddie, me, Christian, Haitao etc all lost some amount of time on this

# [[2018-11-01-Thursday]] - Job Scoping Chat with Elmar

Notes for chat with Elmar:

1. Specific project to work on?
	 1. Next 2 months ramping up with code & infra. Cross collaborate.
2. Lidar or vision?
3. Possibility of project to do publishable work with Google Brain team?
4. Attending conferences at least 2 per year?
5. What do you anticipate the largest learning curve in the first 6 months? What was yours? Legacy code?
6. 1 day from SF to start & possibly 2 days later on?
7. Interaction with perception?
	 1. Mostly /dnn stuff …
8. How much hands on development vs high level architecture?
9. How many people will be in the immediate team? As in people you work with on a daily basis?
10. 2 days work from SF office?
11. Don’t want to interface much with hardware group. Possibility to stay abstracted away from hw?
12. Who is guiding & building requirements docs?
13. Capability driven development? Propose a feature and work to build it
14. SW development cycles? Sprints, JIRA? How are EPMs involved?
15. Don’t want to deal much with legacy code … Rather build stuff & solve cool problems

Chat with Rosie:

Start with your clarifying questions:

1. Engineering level coming in? Well calibrated with google levels through several friends working there. Minimum of level 5… Was L4 at Apple which is equivalent
	 1. Yep, Level 5
2. How does the stock vest? Does the stock vest or the money to buy stock vests? Is it monthly vesting?
3. # of PTO days?? How does vacation work?
	 1. 15 days/ year …. After 3 its 20days .. after 5 years 25 days … 240 hrs max.
	 2. Can go upto 40hrs negative
4. Bonus in salary + refreshers?
5. 200k for 4 years … So refresh equity would modeled for 100k.

———
Talking points:

1. Expectations were based on both current startup comp (which might be speculative) and comp at Apple when I left.
2. RSUs matched with base salary. I do prefer equity heavy packages. If money is vesting then we don’t see the appreciation of the stock price over the years which lets say should be 15-20% annually at least. No-one would want a falling stock price
3. Competitive based on current market rate for robotics related roles in autonomous driving & beyond.
4. If 15% is guaranteed, fine to add that but nothing other than that cuz that’s discretionary. Sampled a bunch of people who mentioned that its usually never 30 … more like 20-25%. BATNA 175k base.
5. Sign on bonus to cover costs for relocating to near a shuttle stop & the options value I leave behind.
6. Negotiate for more vacation days.

Chat with Chris:

1. How stressful & high frequency is it?
2. Opportunities to learn cool stuff? Within team or with collaborating teams?
3. Ease of moving around within X?

Rosie: 11/7

My grant from the Lyft offer is $436000 over 4 years plus the upside from a pre IPO company. Google stock though strong will not grow as rapidly as Lyft stock so need to model that in somehow. Ready to close this and accept your offer if you can do match/better equity package than them. Super excited about the opportunity.

# Fun
