[[2025-04-01-Tuesday]] - I dont know if its worth paying Tanya $1800 to file my taxes - not sure how much value she is adding and does not respond or communicate well or explain any details
[[2025-03-08-Saturday]] : 2024 tax prep questions:
Where is home depreciation used? $9,228?
where do you get 12,389 for cost basis? ![[taxes-2025-03-08.png]]
where is property taxes & home insurance factored in?

- Used an average cost basis - no idea what that means?
- Property tax, depreciation etc can be deducted by a max of 20% of business income -> $5,251
	- Wonder if its really a worth while deduction
- Effective federal tax rate: 23.035%

[[2025-02-14-Friday]]
- Looking to buy an investment property all cash. Should we register it under the business or personal? How about for development expenses of the property?
	- HELOC would be in my name: would that count as a contribution to the company?
- Should I start a new LLC for this or continue under Umri LLC? Should it be in CA or in OR?
- Why does my Fidelity 1099R say $1856.63 is taxable income?
- Do I need to file tax returns in SF? Or is that only for business with gross receipts > $2.25M -> Probably not (usually for high income businesses)
- Can I contribute to IRA and then roll over to Roth IRA? -> Yes do it!

Chat with Tanya:
- [x] Need home Property tax receipts insurance + utilities + internet  [completion:: 2025-02-19]
- 32% of home can be deducted for rent
- Rent is better if I want constant distribution -> just got with a one time deduction of 32% of property taxes + mortgage + home insurance + utilities + internet
- Rental property would need to be in another LLC - only helps with liability
- Could just get insurance for liability - get a hefty one
	- people dont wanna get sued for their personal assets
- LLC is more expensive : 800/mo, S-corp is federal but taxes are personal anyway 
- rental properties usually dont manage under LLC or Scorp
	- only time it makes sense to do that is if you are a realtor and doing this as a fulltime job or business
- rental income is passive it is not earned income - no social secutiry or medicare taxes on it anyway
	- S-corp usually saves you on the payroll taxes which is for actively working on business
- rental incomes are initially not profitable - income needs to add up to the purchase price before it gets 
	- depreciation is 1/27 of the structure is depreciation which can also be claimed every year
- all travel expenses + other deductions like meals etc can be factored for rental development
- HELOC interest is tax deductible - if used to purchase property, upgrades etc
- cost of airstream etc can also be deductible if it is going to be listed for rent
- if airstream is listed for rent on Outdoorsy that might need to be a business
- Roth is after tax dollars and withdrawals are tax free
- [x] Take the money and stick it over into a Traditional IRA then convert it immediately into Roth IRA: 2024 max is $7000 and 2025 is $7000  [completion:: 2025-02-19]

[[2024-07-08-Monday]] Questions to ask after reviewing Tanya's tax prep
- Most of the owner contributions are actually in the form of expenses that were paid - not me adding money to the LLC
- should the office deduction not be more than 2388? - remodel, utilities etc (Umri return): that is just coming from furniture etc
	- how does the % of total remodel expense get factored in?
		- We remodeled our house and use the home also as a company office to run its activities. The remodel expenses totaled $225338.44 for a 1850 sqft home out of which we use 600sq ft for the home office. I have these transactions in a spreadsheet as well if you need them.
- where is the home office depreciation deduction of $7,317 used in the return?
- why is the difference between standard & itemized deduction not that different?
	- are the company deductions bringing down the business income instead?
- how do i withdraw the owner contribution? why does it show up as income?
- why is business income deduction in personal taxes (~18k) less than that in the Umri one (~ 24.7k)?
- I have already made a $25k IRS payment
- Need to add 2k as charitable contribution 
- How can I start withdrawing from my business account as distribution? Just a one time transfer?
-
---
- You can withdraw upto $114k from the company without questions as that is the share basis
- In 2024 it might be easier to pay rent to yourself from company rather than take a home office deduction - maybe pay yourself 12x2k/month
- Minimum estimated tax to own an S-corp in CA is $800/year and then you pay a percent of your income $600/year for Umri - this is in addition to the amount you pay by passing through business income to personal
- Business deduction just bring down business income - they are not deductions in personal taxes
- In 2019 Trump tax cuts increased standard deduction amounts so its less beneficial to own a home to claim itemized deductions. Also add a Qualified Business Income Deduction of 20% of business income (~18k) that you can claim
- For primary home can deduct interest paid on upto 750k of indebtedness. For rental or investment properties the amount of interest deduction claimed is unbounded. Kind of makes sense to finance it if interest rates are lower.

[[2024-05-22-Wednesday]]
- [x] Send her the updated expenses for the categories mentioned. #todo  [completion:: 2024-05-22]
- [x] Submit CA EDD assessment to Quickbooks - they messed up in payroll taxes #todo  [completion:: 2024-05-22]
Dont need balance sheet if income < 250k
- [x] Amend S-corp to include Sana if its an easy thing to do (ask Claude?) #todo
	Can withdraw as much as payroll Sana is taking. since we file jointly it should be all good even though I as owner am not taking payroll [completed:: [[2025-07-12-Saturday]]]

LLCs are only a state designation - not sure what that means entirely
LLC are taxed on income while S-corp taxed on income - expenses so are better tax wise. (I didn't fully understand this part)
For house flipping she recommended just reusing this S-corp for a while until everything gets bigger.
Buying a house all cash is a much easier option that taking out a mortgage for it - for mortgage you can buy the property and then transfer over to the S-corp but the bank would have a lien on it so not sure how that would work? Might need to talk to banker - because then the personal mortgage interest rates wont apply.
Consider just getting a HELOC and then loan that money to the S-corp. The loan can be withdrawn any time and is not taxed.
Income >$584k incurs the 23% capital gains tax rather than 15% (>518k if filing single)

For taxes -If you have a home office, you can deduct part of home remodel as it pertains to your home office. However, this only applies to 1099s or certain business situations

Find out if Umri LLC can claim R&D tax credit?

[[2023-08-14-Monday]]
Chat with Tanya Arana
Questions I had listed:
- Her first few paychecks did not go through the business account - directly to personal. How can I offset this in the books. Just use 1099 number and claim a distribution for it?
- How much payroll to take from LLC to employee (my wife)? She currently makes $80/hr and I have set pay rate at $55/hr  
- She signed a new contract under my LLC starting July but her freelance company usually ends up issuing just one 1099 for the year. If that's the case can we offset the payroll with a year end bonus such that there is no penalty on the quarterly estimated taxes?
	- Does the 1099 to Umri LLC include quarterly split? Or can I just declare a year end bonus or higher salary to avoid the Estimated quarterly payments tax? Or how can we take the distribution
- How do I claim a home office deduction?
- I would like to purchase a car through the LLC since she needs to drive to meet clients at times. How should I go about purchasing this car and also claim the EV tax credit as that is available to companies? How do I buy and claim a car under the LLC? $7500 EV credit
- How do I go about paying quarterly taxes?
- What is CA State EIN?

Conversation:
- First year is usually fine - not too concerned
- Absolutely do not want to retroactively file quarterly
- Its also ok to pull back the shareholders equity whenever you want
- Interest rates are lower for personal car financing -typically people buy in personal and then claim car to business. That might not work for EV credit - 
- S-corp will still be a flow through - only C-corp counts as non flow through - cant do EV credit
- Split half & half - as salary & distribution. Decide how much money you need to meet office expenses?
- you could just have a personal credit card that you use.
- For home office - would need to know square footage of home vs office : take a percent of the home. 
- Would need - balance sheet, income ledger

[[2023-08-10-Thursday]] - Chat with Tanya Arana
$1200 for S-corp + $450 for personal  : recommends combining both for maximal deductions - does not charge for consulations through the year for quick questions around what she is filing for.

Mentioned that there are 3 buckets to pull money from S-corp: 1) payroll, 2) cash distribution from LLC, 3) claiming expenses

## Notes

Remember the IRS limits your state and local tax deduction to $10,000. **Tip**: Add your total state and local taxes (capped at $10,000) to the mortgage interest number you calculated above. If the total is larger than your standard deduction, you'll likely benefit from itemizing.
Charitable contribution deduction with standard deduction is $600 (for joint filing)

# Interest Tracing

**Deducting Mortgage Interest on $1m+ Homes**
The IRS allows you deduct home mortgage interest on the first $750,000 of a mortgage ($375,000 if not married, filing jointly)¹ which is an amazing benefit for homeowners. However in places like San Francisco or New York, it’s almost impossible to find a home where your mortgage isn’t going to exceed that limit, so you’re not able to deduct all the mortgage interest you pay. Well if you fall into that scenario, there’s a tax hack that when executed correctly, will greatly increase the amount of interest you can deduct (note: this is NOT tax advice). Also, I know this won’t be relevant for everyone, but it’s such a great hack for some of you that I wanted to share.

So how it works is that the interest on any money you borrow and then use to invest can be categorized as investment interest expense and deducted from investment gains (e.g., interest, dividends, cap gains) and thus reducing the taxes you’d owe. Two practical ways this could work:

1. If you already have a mortgage over $750,000, you would use your cash to pay that mortgage down to $750,000 and then later do a cash-out refinance to bring the balance of the mortgage back up to however much you want. Then use all the money you cash out to invest.
2. You want to buy a home and can pay for it in cash. Then within 90 days you do a Cash Recoup Mortgage and use all but $750,000 of the cash you get back from the mortgage to invest.

I don’t expect most people to have this much cash just sitting around, but if you recently had a windfall that you’re planning to invest, this could make sense before you make the investment. Or the tax savings could be enough for it to make sense to sell your investments to execute this strategy and then reinvest the money after.

If any of this is interesting, I’d recommend reading this [great blog post](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkN2OhCAMhZ9muNMggo4XXOzNvoZB6Ci7_Bgo47hPvziTNG3apjmnn1YIa0yn3GNGcqUZzx1kgCM7QIRESoY0WyOZ6NkwioEYyU13F3di8_xIAF5ZJzEVIHtZnNUKbQzXRS_EvRdkk9qIxUA_cKpGqjUFTTvVATViEBMF8RFWxVgIGiQ8IZ0xAHFyQ9zzrf-6se8ax3G0-bm0OvraLS6uuVav0tlgjB7Od_ey3v7ZsDYGTNFoFweNDfUVyNjAa4eQgVjJKGO072hXXfKuZa2ZYBBKcaX58KjOWl0eh1jtz41Tv7I2lyWj0r-XPEnSJ7WVrGyo6_Vi8J5XBHOtvgSL5wxBVXXzoYMfyG9e8woBUoVvZoWyG_gwsXFiE-v5B0bFJygVfGQ9qcIm1qsglXO4wVZN5H9995eW) from SVB and **ABSOLUTELY** talking to an accountant beforehand. Also, part of the complexity here is around a concept called “interest tracing” which requires you *trace* the funds to show that they were used for the correct purpose. If you’re interested in learning more about it, Deloitte has a great *[Interest Tracing Guide](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJw1UU3O3CAMPc2wS0QIZCYLFpWqnqD7yANOQptABKb55vZ1ZloJGf_7-dkB4ZLyyx6pkLjERK8DbcSzbEiEWdSCeQreKtOr4W4G4a323cM8RCjTnBF3CJulXFEc9bkFBxRSvCp6Yx69EasFNd8R5qvIS6fNQysE0PM8duNTzvIzGKoPGB1a_IP5lSKKza5ER7n1327qB7_zPFXrcUuBkbUu7exzKRJGYs3DZX__F2a1lstOru6ccOk_4evtbgi-mv99GiWVbAJ3yViooQwuxKVZavDYHn4WwXKGkn0nO15Idy1jGHEwvAE4PcxmMK2r82mW8Oum5b6ottRnIXC_L4wi2z3DWguEyOHlouvtZ7Ym_vcaA70mjPDc0H-IpM893tROC0bMfCc_Adlu0MOo7qMaVa8_vDHTRkqj76oXPNgnrooWto1WXBlE-Qv-_6Tm)*.
