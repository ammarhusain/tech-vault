## HELOC

[[2025-02-14-Friday]] : Full appraisal [[home appraisal - 117 topaz way -2025-02-15.pdf]] - $1,640,000
Chat with with Hanna (US Bank)
- My rate is going to be 1.05% over prime rate (current variable rate = 8.55%); fixed option is currently cheaper at 8.4% where prime rate = 7.5% 
	- The 1.05% is determined by my credit line being the max allowable 80% loan to value; at 70% the offset rate <1.05% 
- Max permissible Loan to Value today is : $286000 (80% of the home value minus the mortgage balance)
	- (0.8 * 1,640,000 = appraised value) - (1,026,000 = mortgage balance atm)
- Debt to Income ratio was pretty high (52% to get the max loan to value credit line = $286k) -> their max is 50% and therefore the credit line offered is $245000
- Income from underwriter was $28,911
- Some debts: 
	- property tax = $2445/mo, mortgage was padded to be at max ARM rate of 9.5% = $7075/mo (vs $5583 original)
	- volvo car loan = $642/mo, amex credit ~ $120/mo and 6 other credit card accounts with minor balances
- Need to keep credit line open for 2.5 years or pay $500 - no way to increase credit line without going through full underwriter process again.
[[2025-03-06-Thursday]] HELOC secured! $268,768.14
