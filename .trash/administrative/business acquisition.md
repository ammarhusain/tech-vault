	- Started it over covid - then blew up over time. Moved from Etsy to Shopify
	- Motivation for selling: at capacity , need to hire people - want to be more present with the kids; Retiring from military
	- Falls under cottage food - could get moved to a commercial space - needed to fulfill more orders
	- Never a shortage of new products to make
	- Cake pops ship really well in the winter
	- Explored chilled shipping - but hard to make it work
	- <6k email subscribers - have preferred ordering
	- 1 day turn around time for her
	- 2k order per year,
	- Shopify does a great job - handling bookkeeping, e-commerce etc
	- $10k worth of equipment - would need to arrange transport
	- Commercial 20 qt
	- <10k customers, 60% return rate on customers, bulk of orders from CA & west coast, FL, NY
	- Has shipped to EU, UK etc - possibly just that shipping is expensive
	- 14 days at room temp, 6-12 months in a freezer
	- So much demand from website that did not need to go with Whole Foods, Safeway etc
	- Dont spend anything on ads or marketing - 19k followers on instagram
	- Brand is not tied to Melissa herself
	- $50-60k SDE per year
	- 60% profit margin
	- Won dessert wars expo
	- Transfer social media, customer base, equipment (optional), Shopify storefront, recipes - broken down by menu (~120 menus)
	- Shopify takes 2.6% - use shippo for shipping (customer pays for shipping) - handling fees covers boxes etc
	- U-line for packaging supplies, corrugated boxes, crinkle paper, branded tape - can get a small scale machine for $20k: Italian machine

# Parkers Crazy Cookies

#### **Open Questions:**
-  Why are there 2 2022 P&Ls with different numbers?

#### **Ideas**
- Can we have a 1-5 hosted models for caricature or line art generation within the webform itself
	- [https://huggingface.co/spaces/RiverZ/ICEdit](https://huggingface.co/spaces/RiverZ/ICEdit)
	- [https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/control_v11p_sd15_lineart](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/control_v11p_sd15_lineart)
	- Then use vector file and automate the CAM generation
- Innovate on cookie
	- Make more buttery, crumbly
	- Healthier alternatives?
	- Chocolate or other coating?

	- P&L anybody can create - tax returns are more official (make sure they are signed)
	- Need to get YTD: P&L, balance sheet & cash flow statement (need to see what monies have come in)
	- Any worthwhile seller will make sure tax returns are ready
	- If COGS is so low, sometimes the wages might not get included
	- [ ] are they employees or just 1099 workers? 
		- look for line items: payroll tax & workers comp insurance
	- 5-10% of revenue is a good estimate for advertising
	- recipe ~5k, customer list = 0, 
	- SBA loans do not provide pre-approval; they ll need the last 3 years tax returns for even applying for the loan

- [[2025-06-11-Wednesday]] Chat with Tanya
	- Were still able to pull off a $15k profit in 2024 which is impressive - not loss making
	- Advertising $38k, revenue $233k: 16% is a lot for advertising; they are not advertising in the right place
	- COGS is very low which is good
	- Advertising is high
	- Product looks good - it's a management problem; surprised that there is a profit
	- Goodwill is not much - maybe $30-40k
	- COGS including shipping is only 23%, which is low but shipping can be bumped down; look for local contracts
	    - COGS being so low gives you a lot of leeway
	- Fixed fees of the business are not bad
	- Total assets in 2020 were $39k; in 2019 - $57k
	- FF&E is the equipment price
	- Because they let the business go down, they lost customers
	- $100-125k is Tanya's number
	- Will need somebody to take risks; trajectory is going down
	- FF&E stays almost the same; leasehold improvements would be $0 (since we relocate); something for recipe, technology - curious what "etc." is
	- S-corp will be cheaper tax-wise, but more bookkeeping
	- Installment sale - they don't share in profits, just interest payments
	- Have your own S-corp - just change the type of business
	    - Change the DBA of the business; you have to apply to get fictitious name - they can transfer over the name to you ($40/year for California)
	    - Trademark is slogans & logos, so it does not matter
	- If you can get repeat customers and get a recurring stream, that will set you off
	- Might be better to have a separate S-corp because Umri is saving Sana on SS & Medicare taxes (saving $13k/year in taxes)
	    - S-corps are $800/year
	- $275-300k is what they should have paid
	- You don't know where you will be income-wise
	- Make sure to get the tax returns - they tell you everything
	- If you pay $100k that's a good deal and not much loss - business does have potential
	- Will need a lot of TLC to get business back to a good state
	- No personal expenses are being booked as expenses, so not much discretionary earnings

- [[2025-05-16-Friday]] Chat with Gwendolyn Wright
	- 10% on the dollar for equipment if it’s actually 20 years old
	- Find the serial numbers to all the big equipment - find when it was manufactured, when it can be replaced
	- They can’t sell customer base, no long term contracts
	    - They are approved vendors - but that’s not as much value
	- Find a place that used to be a restaurant - retail facing front and then
	    - Vibrant SF loan program targets small businesses (start up or existing) - need a signed LOI
	        - $100k loan program (5 years with 4 years interest) + $25k grant
	        - Main Street Launch program downtown San Francisco
	- $250/sq foot to make it food eligible - can take a year to get permits done - would need to build a commercial kitchen
	    - Vs a restaurant which is plug and play
	- You can really negotiate the price down
	    - Walk around and look for signs in the area
	- You should only look at net discretionary earnings from the last 3 years and use 2-3x multiplier
	- What are they selling? - how did they come up with the $175k number
	    - Assets
	    - Not the website or the order flow
	    - Not the customers
	    - Not the employees
	    - No value except the hard equipment
	- Net earnings for last 3 years: (110 + 25 + 15) / 3 = 50
	    - Add back expenses (like depreciation, personal travel, etc.) if there are any
	- P&L we don’t care - look at tax return
	- Put down an LOI with XYZ contingencies (contingent on small business loan) at an agreed upon price based on review of the financials of the company (financial and operational due diligence including):
	    - Point of sale systems (QuickBooks accounts) - bookkeeping
	        - How many customers? How many returning customers? Average order value? # of sales
	    - Tax returns: 2023
	    - P&L, statement of cash flow, balance sheet for 2025
	    - List of assets
	    - Confirmation of useful life of all equipment: serial numbers, purchase date
	    - Last 12 months of bank statements
	    - Job descriptions for all employees
	    - Payroll
	    - Confirmation of employees vs subcontractors
	- Operational due diligence: observe a full bake - maybe say you are a potential investor
	- Look up difference between stock sale & asset sale
	    - Need purchase agreement, seller’s agreement
	        - Mention staggered purchase
	        - number of hours of training
	- Goodwill of the company is $0 - no brand recognition
	- They’ll try to mix the two (assets & stock sales) together
	- Asset valuation-based methods
	- If they are subcontractors, then they are avoiding payroll taxes
	- You don’t want attorney or accountant involved until you are in the purchase agreement phase
	- It might be better to offer sellers a low purchase price but skin in the game on net profits with a staggered purchase
	    - If the business can be recovered, then you get a cut of that recovery
	    - Build a scenario where net income is back to where it was and show them they get to $175k through their share in the business


- [[2025-05-12-Monday]] Site visit to Hayward

		- 7am start - 2.30pm pickup UPS
		- 16 prints in one cylinder of the dough cutting machine
		- Rotor molder machine for imprinting
		- Dough needs to be dry for the machine - therefore no milk or eggs
		- One of the bakers does the maintenance - guy in San Jose for servicing if needed

	- Sheena K - BizBuySell: [Speciality Online Bakery with Proven Owner-Operator Sales \>$700k/year in Alameda County, California - BizBuySell](https://www.bizbuysell.com/business-opportunity/speciality-online-bakery-with-proven-owner-operator-sales-700k-year/2347204/), 
		-  [[2025-04-30-Wednesday-2025-04-30.png|BizBuySell listing]]
		- Only owned it since June 2023 - started 2005
		- Located in Hayward - micro specialty baking; custom made to order cookies
		- Make cookies of a caricature of person, pet, boat, building etc
		- Previous owner was doing ~1M in sales - was a fulltime operator
		- Current owner: Sheena & husband are absentee owners (did not seem to work well): biz has shrunk significantly - halved in revenue from ~450k pre purchase amount. They work in tech 
			- Bought it for 365k 2 years ago
			- Was pitched as an absentee owner business but that was not true - selling at a big loss
			- She sees a lot of upside - lots of recurring customers; private events, universities
		- Business is nationwide with online store - can ship nationwide
		- Licensee of UC Berkeley (plan to expand out to other UCs); branded gift industrial scale (enterprise customers); worked on underside of the cookie (chocolate backing - made it really delicious)
		- business has no refrigeration; no walk in fridge - cookies stay fresh - no eggs or dairy
		- cannot do gluten free - requires a gluten free facility (but there is a flour everywhere): can label it wheat free potentially
		- only 1 type of cookie that is baked (vanilla - between animal cracker & shortbread) - lots of upside with different flavors
		- Got into it because Sheena & her husband got really into baking during Covid - thought about having a baking business
		- Nobody does detailed caricature on the cookie itself - printing the picture on the cookie icing
		- 150 cookie minimum (99c / cookie for faces) -> reduced to 50 min () -- could increase price a bit more too
		- people upload pics -> sent to artists for caricature (overseas) -> get sent to customers for approval -> designer (1x week) converts the design from 2D to 3D -> sent to milling for plastic mold  ---> 50% of upfront cost
			- back & forth with customer can be automated workflow -- never got to it because of time bandwidth
		- 1-2 week lead time from order to shipping
		- Even at its peak - most orders were coming in online: a lot of email based orders if not from website
		- 2 as needed artists (variable cost); 1 order processor (4-5 hrs / day x 7 days ): offshore; 1 local designer (~20hrs/week), 1 office admin (4 days/ week); team of 3 for the bakes & packaging; 
		- Have the machine to do the milling
	- What are the assets? How many employees? where does the upside come from - more marketing, customer? Competition? other cookie types - sugar free etc
		- Can this business be moved to Oakland or SF? How much equipment? When can we come visit?
- [[2025-05-09-Friday]]
	- Loss of productivity: needed oversight and had questions that needed answering
	- All employees are contractors & hourly
	- Hired a new grad office admin Erica (bring her on full time is recommendation), 2 artists are offshore
	- 1600 sqft facility - kitchen with baking
	- Need more social media presence
	- 2 key differences between Dave & her: 1) not physically there, 2) he did a lot more social media - higher ad spend
	- Highly relocatable - ideally outside the Bay area: staff is very local
		- Olga & Meldon are expert bakers: they should be the ones training - have a lot of history
		- Milling process: one person needs to be trained to do the milling - train one of the bakers to do the milling
		- Oakland you might be able to keep talent; supplies can be sourced anywhere
	- Some corporate repeat customers: attorneys, accountants, firms, couples universities departments (UChicago, Michigan, Berkeley)
		- universities just came about because they were existing customers
		- any organization that has a core identity can be targeted - edible branding
		- currently events based but can also be used for gifting
		- Dave really developed relationships with local government as well
	- Will send list of assets; upgraded website - 2 year lease that runs out June 30th will do month to month
		- $2300/ mo includes all additional fees (NNN); utilities are variable costs
	- 2500-4000 cookies they baked per day
		- Can scale to several their size - grossly underutilized
		- Only bake once a week - facility is idle 6 of 7 days
		- Dave used to bake 3-4 times per week
		- Bottleneck is not baking capacity
		- Easier to retain staff if you give them more hours
	- SW subscriptions: ShipStation, CarvaCo for CAD/CAM, MailChimp, 
	- Biggest skill needed is sales & marketing - less on the tactical steps (needs more creativity there)
		- Day to day stuff can be done super easily; basic process can be offloaded fairly easily
		- Digital marketing and ads; Pinterest, Instagram, upload pictures, google - no presence on tiktok
	- Did not take a cent off the business: no salary - 
		- Dave was taking salary, medical, 401k
