### Notes
[How to Save Money on Taxes with an LLC - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PmF4u33W3I)

S-corp is better when the business has an income. It leads to savings on payroll taxes. Great video explaining the difference: [Why You Should NOT Form an LLC! - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUpyc89bgBU)
	- Basically you can choose to pay yourself less in payroll which is where you have to pay social security & medicare tax => 15.3%
	- For LLC all of the business income must pay SS & medicare tax (aka payroll tax).
- In general, with around $40,000 net income you should consider converting to S-Corp. Depending on your circumstances the breakeven point could even be as low as $25,000 net income.

[Limited liability company | FTB.ca.gov](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/file/business/types/limited-liability-company/index.html)
		- Every LLC that is doing business or organized in California must pay an annual tax of $800.
		- For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2021, and before January 1, 2024, LLCs that organize, register, or file with the Secretary of State to do business in California are not subject to the annual tax of $800 for their first tax year.
		- Must pay an additional CA tax of 1.5% of net income [[taxes#Accountant]] - $1465 for [[taxes#2023]]

[Top 5 Tax Write-Offs For LLC’s - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kpUjfabW9k)

- $5000 worth of startup cost/operational cost is deductible in the first year
- Home office deduction - divide percent of square footage of office over the square footage of your home
- Vehicle deduction -
	- 58c per mile deduction
	- Can also deduct depreciation of the vehicle (amortized over time)
		- For a 50k vehicle you can depreciate 10k of the vehicle each year (if you take a straight line depreciation deduction)
	- For vehicles over 6000 lbs, you can write off the entire vehicle in one year
- Marketing & advertising - can be expensed 100%
- Turning your LLC to S-corp: you can control how much you pay yourself, eliminates the payroll tax
