## 3. Financial Analysis

Based on the available financial documents from 2018-2024:

### Revenue Trends
- According to the listing, the business reports annual revenue of approximately $700,000
- Based on file naming conventions and business history, it appears the business was sold to the current owners (Sheena K Foods) in 2023
- Sales appear to have declined since the ownership change in 2023, as mentioned in the listing description

### Profitability
Without being able to extract detailed numbers from the PDFs, we can make some general observations:
- Custom cookie businesses typically operate with gross margins between 50-70%
- Net profit margins for specialty food businesses typically range from 10-25% depending on operational efficiency
- The business likely has recurring fixed costs for:
  - Production facility lease
  - Equipment maintenance
  - Labor (production, packaging, customer service)
  - Ingredients and packaging materials
  - Marketing and website maintenance
  - Shipping and logistics

### Business Model Insights
- The business appears to operate primarily through e-commerce, with both B2C and B2B revenue streams
- The absentee ownership model since 2023 may have contributed to the reported sales decline
- The company's unique photo printing technology likely represents a significant asset and competitive advantage

## 4. Valuation Assessment

### Valuation Approaches

1. **Multiple of Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE)**
   - Small food manufacturing businesses typically sell for 2.5-3.5x SDE
   - Given the specialized nature and unique technology, a multiple in the 3.0-3.5x range may be appropriate
   - If we estimate SDE at 15-20% of revenue ($105,000-$140,000), this yields a valuation range of $315,000-$490,000

2. **Revenue Multiple**
   - Specialty food businesses typically sell for 0.6-1.0x annual revenue
   - Given the reported decline in sales and absentee ownership, a multiple in the lower end (0.6-0.7x) may be appropriate
   - At $700,000 annual revenue, this yields a valuation range of $420,000-$490,000

3. **Asset-Based Valuation**
   - Key assets likely include:
     - Proprietary cookie printing technology/equipment
     - Brand IP (name, logo, website)
     - Customer list and relationships
     - Recipes and production processes
     - Inventory and supplies
     - Production facility improvements

### Recommended Purchase Price Range
Based on the limited information available, a reasonable purchase price range would be **$350,000-$450,000**.

### Key Value Considerations

1. **Declining Sales**: The reported decline in sales since the current owners took over suggests either mismanagement or market challenges, which should lead to a discount in the valuation.

2. **Absentee Ownership**: The current absentee ownership model presents both a risk (continued decline) and opportunity (potential for immediate improvement with active management).

3. **Unique Technology**: The photo printing technology represents a significant value driver and competitive advantage that could justify a premium over standard food business valuations.

4. **Growth Potential**: The business appears to have untapped growth potential, particularly if an active owner-operator takes over from the current absentee owners.

5. **Market Trends**: The growing market for personalized and premium food gifts supports a forward-looking valuation approach.
