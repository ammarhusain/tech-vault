[[2023-12-05-Tuesday]] Signed up for Chase Private Client today. I think I ll move all my equity & cash from both Citibank & Schwab over to Chase.

Principles:
From Brandon Bouier @ Google. Avoid the following:

- holding on to losing positions too long   **<-- AKA cut losses early**
- waiting too long to take profits (allowing some to become losses, triggering the prior point)  **<-- AKA don't get greedy, identify your expected gain and take profits when gain is reached**
- setting stops too wide   **<-- focus on setting appropriate stops based on the security being traded, the environment you're trading in, and your own trading history**
- overleverage on illiquid positions that blew past my (already too wide) stops when the market turned down  **<-- AKA approach each trade risk-first, and tailor your risk management to the security being traded**
- lack patience  **<-- AKA don't force a trade based on what you think (or hope) will happen; wait for the evidence to present itself that the odds of success will be in your favor, THEN trade. Wait for the right trade to come to you.**

Dollar cost average when both buying and selling
I invest in low cost index funds, I speculate with individual stocks.

[[2021-08-11-Wednesday]] - Vanguard office hours with Joshua:

- Retirement accounts are individuals. Spouse doesn't
- $58k limit for qualified plan assets: includes you + employer
	 - $19.5k salary deferred - pre or after tax + 50% match → $29,250 (Recommended to do pre-tax to get taxes down)
		  - Roth = pay [[taxes]] now then no tax after (earnings tax free)
		  - - $28750 after tax contribution → convert to Roth rightaway. [Mega backdoor]
					 - Earnings will be taxed as income + penalty if withdrawn before 59.5... Principal can be withdrawn
		  - Backdoor IRA $6k (this is too complicated ... stop doing it) ... Spousal IRA
				- File an additional 8606 form IRA.
		  - go/401k : 2 videos.
