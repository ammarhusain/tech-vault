# Bowline Knot

[Bowline Knot | Animated Knots by Grog](https://www.animatedknots.com/bowline-knot)

- Makes a reasonably secure loop in the end of a piece of rope.
- It has many uses, e.g., to fasten a mooring line to a ring or a post.
- Under load, it does not slip or bind.
- With no load it can be untied easily.
- Two bowlines can be linked together to join two ropes.
- Its principal shortcoming is that it cannot be tied, or untied, when there is a load on the standing end. It should therefore be avoided when, for example, a mooring line may have to be released under load.

## Eskimo Bowline

Knot is tied around part of the loop instead of around the Standing End. It is preferred when the loop will be stretched wide and is also claimed to better resist shaking loose.

Valuable knot usually used for securing loads or tarpaulins.
Use the Trucker’s Hitch to cinch down a load. This combination of knots allows a line to be pulled very tight. Probably the most useful hitch there is, the Trucker’s Hitch allows a line to be pulled tight as a guitar string and secured. It is used by truckers to secure heavy loads in place and works equally well tying canoes and other objects to the tops of cars.
