### Egypt
DM: Hussein
Wetsuit: 5mm & 6kg weight
First dive was air and then all subsequent ones were nitrox with EANx range 28-30
- **Dive #50: [[2025-04-12-Saturday]] Poseidon Gardens**
	- Check dive - beautiful and shallow coral garden
- **Dive #51: [[2025-04-12-Saturday]] Thistlegorm dusk dive**
	- Went up & down on a line - was around sunset when we descended and dark when we got back up
	- lots of lion fish, crocodile fish, cool jelly fish,
- **#52: [[2025-04-13-Sunday]] Thistlegorm wreck back side**
	- saw ammunition and propellers, 1 lion fish
- **#53: [[2025-04-13-Sunday]] Thistlegorm inside cabins**
	- went into the second and first floor cargo cabins, saw motorcycles, cars, radiators, so much cool stuff… was fully loaded when it sank by German air bombardment. Was initially apprehensive going into the cabins but was one of the coolest dives I’ve ever done in my life.
- **#54: [[2025-04-13-Sunday]] Ras Mohamed - Yolanda and shark reef**
	- coral reef with a drop off wall that is more than 500m deep. Beautiful corals and reef fish. Saw many Tuna. Was quite underweight- started floating towards the end as my tank emptied out. Husain gave me a kg in my hand to help sink down a bit. I sucked up a lot of air trying to get down because of that - had to end dive around 45 mins because of me. 
	- Turns out I was not emptying out my wing nd there was air still trapped in there
	- ![[scuba diving-2025-07-05.png]]
	- ![[scuba diving-2025-07-05-1.png]]

- **#55: [[2025-04-13-Sunday]] Tiran Lagoon (DM: Ashraf)**
	- night dive, there was a bit of bioluminescence but only very little. Saw an eel swim by which was super cool to see. Easy dive sandy bottom and stayed pretty shallow. Struggled with buoyancy during the safety stop again.
- **#56 [[2025-04-14-Monday]] Tiran Jackson Reef**
	- there was a bit of current. Beautiful coral wall. Messed up my buoyancy towards the end when Michael and Hussain pulled me down from 5 to 10m. Had air stuck in my BCD. The bungee on the wing hose is making it hard to pull it up and press the release button. I needed to pull the back release cord while swimming down.
	- ![[scuba diving-2025-07-05-2.png]]
- **#57: [[2025-04-14-Monday]] Tiran: Gordon reef** 
	- beautiful coral field. Super easy dive. My buoyancy and air consumption was on point - one of my calmest dives ever and probably the longest too. Saw a few puffer fish and two spotted rays. Some very large Gorgonians too
	- ![[scuba diving-2025-07-05-3.png]]
- **#58: [[2025-04-14-Monday]] Ras Mohamed : Anemon reef -> shark reef -> Yolanda reef** 
	- drift dive ; saw a turtle , 2 eels, lots of clown fish and the coral hair (aka anemon) which was beautiful. Crossing from anemon reef to Yolanda reef was like going through an abyss very deep ridge
	- ![[scuba diving-2025-07-05-4.png]]
- **#59 [[2025-04-14-Monday]] - Shaab Mahmoud - night dive**
	- saw a bunch of eels, lion fish etc. Buoyancy was fine but made a bunch of stupid errors that threw me off. Didn’t wear mask jumping in the water, then flashlight died 10 mins into the dive, then lost GoPro that thankfully Tobi recovered. Overall dive was fine but I need to be mindful and extra careful
	- ![[scuba diving-2025-07-05.jpeg]]
- **#60: [[2025-04-15-Tuesday]] - Shaab Mahmoud - Dunraven ship wreck** 
	- ![[scuba diving-2025-07-05-5.png]]
- **#61: [[2025-04-15-Tuesday]] Carnatic ship wreck : Sha’ab Abu Nu Has** 
	- dotted blue ray, schools of glass fish, pipe fish
	- ![[scuba diving-2025-07-05-6.png]]
	- 
- **#62: [[2025-04-15-Tuesday]] - Ghiannis D : Sha’ab Abu Nu Has** 
	- beautiful ship wreck, probably my second favorite after Thistlegorm. Diving technique was pretty good overall - struggle to get back on to zodiac after the dive in the swell. I should also really start looking around more to appreciate my surroundings and get a full picture of the ship wreck scene. I find myself too zoomed on individual corals and fish rather than build full spatial awareness and scene reconstruction. Saw a scorpion fish, school of glass fish
	- ![[scuba diving-2025-07-05-7.png]]
- **#63: [[2025-04-15-Tuesday]] - Dolphin house - night dive**
	- just swam around the boat for 45 mins or so going into the channel and back : saw eel, little shrimp, several hermit crabs
	- ![[scuba diving-2025-07-05-1.jpeg]]
- **#64: [[2025-04-16-Wednesday]] - Dolphinhouse Shaab el Erg** 
	- easy dive pretty shallow. Got dropped off by zodiac and then swam back to the boat. I dropped my mask into the water from the zodiac (like an idiot). Ashraf had to dive in and recover it.
	- There was one coral that had an Octopus, a clown fish on anemon, lion fish and spider shrimp. No dolphins though :(
- **#65 [[2025-04-16-Wednesday]] -  Umm Gamar** 
	- fun and easy dive. Was quite packed with a lot of divers from other boats too. Went into a small cave at 25m which was quite cool.

# Notes

- [[2025-03-28-Friday]] Hook the LPI to the Halcyon jacket outside the rubber ring that has the main hose
	- Service the Halcyon jacket once a year by replacing the inflator part; service the regulator every 2 years
	- At the end of dive trip take a water jet and spray into the hose opening and let water get into the wing. Then shake water around and then let it go by pulling on the dump valve 
	- It is ok to soak the Atomic regulator and clean it that way. Just make sure to have the dust cap on - that should always be on when not connected to a tank. Can also spray jet water into it and will come out of the regulator itself.
	- AquaLung dive computer: [[i300C_owners_manual_EN.pdf]]

- [[2025-02-18-Tuesday]]
	- Visited Any water and Diver Dans yesterday - got even more confused lol
	- I think I will go with Diver Dan recommendation of the Halcyon Evolve with Aluminum plate
	- Hydros Pro is a good option but gets a lot of hate on reddit - also not as modular as the BPW option. According to lady at Diver Dan Halcyon Evolve can pack down to the same size if not lighter

- [[2025-02-08-Saturday]]
	- ![[scuba diving-2025-02-08-bcd-options.png]]
	- Ian at Any Water Sports in San Jose was pretty helpful
	- Says you can dive with pretty much any wetsuit in tropical weather
	- scubapro hydros pro is the best versatile BCD for both travel & using in Monterey
	- S620 TI ($1185) or S600 ($1080) regulators (best options): scuba pro anywhere in world can service
	- Excel wetsuits are good for Monterey : 7mm+ start at $600+ with hood
	- ScubaPro Go BCD seems to be lighter than the Hydros Pro. (5.6lb vs 11.3ls??)
	- Should I get BPI or Air2?

[[2023-10-20-Friday]]
No Deco time is the time left for you to be underwater at that time without needing a decompression stop. Most recreational dives are done without needing a decompression stop - just a safety stop. If you are too deep for very long No Deco Time will shrink really quickly. As you ascend and get shallower No Deco Time might add back up. The Apple Watch ultra face is split into two halves by the no deco time bar graph (4 horizontal lines corresponding to 25 mins chunks).

# Nitrox
![[scuba diving nitrox ecard-2025-04-21.png]]
### Learnings
79 nitrogen, 21% oxygen in regular air

Nitrox has higher oxygen percent up to a max of 40%

Increases your no deco or no stop time up to a certain depth than regular air - extends your allowable bottom time

![[scuba diving-2025-07-05-9.png]]

Body absorbs less nitrogen so less risk of bubble formation since body absorbs the oxygen
Narcosis might be the same at depth with nitrox and regular air as both nitrogen and oxygen can cause it ( drunkenness)

**Gear**
- Excess oxygen in the tank can cause oxidation reactions on your gear. Oxygen >40% requires special gear with specialized lubricants, o ring etc. Certain materials like oils and lubricants can cause fire or explosion when in contact with pure oxygen
- Partial pressure blending is one technique of filling in nitrox. It starts with filling the cylinder with pure oxygen first and then adding air to it to get the target EANx oxygen percent for the tank.
- Partial pressure blending is getting phased out in favor of other blending methods like using a membrane to separate nitrogen and oxygen.
- EANx30 means a tank with 30% oxygen
- Service gear once a year when diving with nitrox 
- EANx32 (nitrox 1) and EANx36 (nitrox 2) are the most common blends

**Oxygen Toxicity**
- oxygen partial pressure PO2 is simply the percent of oxygen in the enriched air tank and the pressure at depth. 
- At 10m the pressure is 2 bar: one from atmosphere and one bar from 10m water. So with EANx40 the partial pressure PO2 is 0.4 x 2  = 0.8
- Maximum oxygen partial pressure for enriched air diving is 1.4 bar/ata. Contingency limit is 1.6. Dives beyond this limit can cause oxygen toxicity
- The warning signs and symptoms for oxygen toxicity, if they do occur, include:
	- visual disturbances, including tunnel vision
	- ears ringing
	- nausea
	- twitching or muscle spasms, especially in the face
	- irritability, restlessness, euphoria or anxiety
	- dizziness
- Some divers remember these by remembering VENTID - vision, ears, nausea, twitching, irritability and dizziness.
- Central nervous system CNS convulsions may occur if affected by oxygen toxicity. These can occur without warning and may cause diver to lose regulator and drown

Diving at altitude reduces your no stop time. Nitrox can help extend it but it’s not a definitive strategy

Any nitrox based emergency such as convulsions should be handled exactly the same as any other emergency- bring diver to surface ASAP, administer CPR if needed, give 100% oxygen, contact EMS. In case of convulsions it may at times be better to hold the regulator in their mouth until the convulsions subside and then bring them up.

## Introduction

Master Scuba Diver™ (the highest nonprofessional rating in recreational diving).
a general reserve air supply is 50 bar/500 psi. Fifty bar actually equals 725 psi, but 50 bar/500 psi are easy figures to reference on an SPG

## Think like a Diver

Four central skills shape experienced, prudent divers’ thinking:

### Planning Dives with Secondary Objectives
- Every dive’s primary objective is for all divers to return safely. must be a well executed & safe dive.
- Examples of secondary objectives could be finding a specific organism that interests you, or learning a new skill.
- The biggest mistake involving secondary objectives is forgetting that they are secondary.
- Dive incidents have resulted from divers exceeding planned limits – time, depth, gas supply, etc. – because they were trying to accomplish their secondary objective. Sometimes, the divers thought it was okay to “slightly” push or exceed limits because they had “almost” reached their secondary objective.
- Don’t “push” your safety margin for a secondary objective; you can often plan another dive to finish it.

### Developing and Applying Situational Awareness

Think of this like "spheres" that surround you
![[Pasted image 20230316130823.png|600]]

- Think of your gas as having four basic divisions: outbound, return, ascent and reserve gas.
![[Pasted image 20230316131214.png|500]]
- When any diver in your buddy team reaches turn pressure, the dive turns.
- If you reach ascent pressure before reaching the ascent point, you know to ascend where you are and swim to your exit on the surface (as appropriate for the conditions).
- If you exit the water with less than your planned reserve pressure, and you didn’t have an unexpected problem, then you had a problem with gas planning or gas management.
- Never allow yourself to overexert and get out of breath underwater. If you begin to feel anxious, lightheaded and/or air starved, immediately stop, signal your buddy(ies) and catch your breath. Abort the dive or continue at a slower pace.
- Swimming even 3 metres/10 feet shallower may reduce gas consumption significantly. This may not be a good tactic if you’re (unexpectedly) swimming against a current – current tends to be weaker near the bottom – but it is often an option.
Other elements of situational awareness
1. No stop time. Remain aware of:
- Your no stop time remaining.
- How soon you should ascend to remain well within no stop limits.

1. Environment. Remain aware of:
- Changes in wave/current/surge strength and/or the direction.
- Increases/decreases in visibility or temperature.
- Changes in water density – i.e., going from fresh to salt water or vice versa.
- Your interactions – touching, disturbing or otherwise affecting aquatic life.

1. Equipment. Remain aware of:
- Proper operation – note minor problems that could become major problems.
- Adjustment/fit – especially releases that can slowly loosen.
- Accessories, instruments, etc. – where and how they are secured.

1. Hazards. Remain aware of:
- Hazards noted during dive planning.
- Unexpected hazards.
- Degree of hazard – is it, or has it become, higher than expected (e.g., you expected jellyfish in the area, but there are dozens, not just a couple as you expected)? Can you avoid it, or should you end the dive?

1. Depth. Remain aware of:
- Your present depth.
- Your rate and direction of depth change.
- How far you would descend before being stopped by a physical barrier.
- The consequences of descending that far.

1. Navigation, orientation and location. Remain aware of:
- Where you are and where you came from.
- The most direct route to your ascent point/exit.
- Where you’re going.

1. Buddy status and location. Remain aware of:
- Buddy’s(ies’) location.
- Communications.
- Factors that may affect buddy(ies) – e.g., gas supplies, hazards, thermal comfort, etc.

1. Secondary objective. Remain aware of:
- Secondary objectives staying secondary.
- How soon you must quit your secondary objective due to gas use, no stop time or other dive limits.

### Managing Task Loading

Negative buoyancy -> sinking
Dive First, Situation Second, Communicate Third - thinking strategy when confronted with situations where a lot is going on.

#### Dive First

Regardless of what is going on around you, your top priority is functioning well as a diver. This means having your buoyancy under control, operational scuba equipment, maintaining the ability to swim, controlling stress and breathing from your diaphragm, etc. Correct, adjust or change anything that requires it.
This is top priority, because not functioning well is an underlying cause of problems. If not the cause, it can make a problem worse, impede your ability to deal with it and impede assisting a buddy.

#### Situation Second

Deal with anything that demands your attention based on situational awareness according to urgency and importance. Confirm where you are, your depth and so on, as necessary.

#### Communicate Third

Situation Second includes your buddy. But, communication comes after dealing with the situation. There is overlap. Dealing with situational demands may naturally require buddy communication, and what a buddy communicates may be what alerts you to the situation. But, communication that’s not immediately related to external factors that can affect you or your buddy comes last.

### Maintaining Good Dive Habits

Part of being a diver is accepting that problems will occur. Your training helps you avoid most of these problems, but things go wrong, so your training also helps you deal with emergencies. Scientists have found that under stress, thinking tends to become slow and impaired. The more urgent the response needed, the greater the impairment.
A wholly or partially effective response tends to lower stress and lead to clearer thinking with better problem-solving. Good habits based on training even benefit complex situations, because knowing where to start helps reduce stress and expand thinking.
Habits that help you:

1. Conduct predive safety checks.
2. Keep the mask on and breathe from your snorkel/regulator whenever you’re in water too deep in which to stand.
3. Maintain buoyancy whenever you’re at the surface.
4. Turn the dive with ample no stop time remaining and ample gas supply remaining. Begin your ascent with ample gas supply remaining. Plan ample reserve.
5. Dive conservatively, within your limits.

## Underwater Navigation
### Introduction

Fun and rewarding experience. Has the following benefits:

- Reduces Anxiety and Confusion
- Helps Avoid Long Surface Swims
- Increases Dive Plan Effectiveness
- Helps Avoid Buddy Separation
- Conserves Gas
### Distance Estimation

To navigate, you really only need to know two things: which way you’re headed, and how far you’ve gone.
3 common methods for distance estimation:

#### Kick Cycles

A kick cycle is the distance you cover when both of your legs complete one fin stroke. To track kick cycles, choose either leg and count each time that leg returns to the same position. The distance you travel in one kick cycle is usually consistent. If it takes you 40 kick cycles to swim 30 metres/100 feet, for example, you know you travel about 0.75 metres/2.5 feet with each kick cycle. Then, if you were to swim 100 kick cycles, you’ll know you’d have traveled approximately 75 metres/250 feet.

#### Elapsed time

You can also gauge distance underwater by measuring the time it takes to swim a known distance. If you know it takes you 30 seconds to swim about 30 metres/100 feet, for example, you can estimate your travel distance by timing your swim.

#### Cylinder Pressure

You can use gas pressure to measure distances much as you use elapsed time, because at about the same depth and activity level, your gas consumption is relatively uniform. A specific distance per bar/psi is only accurate at a relatively constant depth and breathing rate. This makes using gas consumption less useful for measuring metres/feet when the depth changes significantly over the distance you’re measuring, or if your exertion level changes while swimming.

### Natural Navigation
#### Predive Observations

Natural navigation begins before you dive, by looking at the environment for navigational references.

##### Water Motion

The direction of waves, currents and tides, while changeable, usually remains consistent over the length of a dive (though directions change once in a while – especially tidal flow). You can determine wave and current direction by watching floating debris, and in the case of tides by consulting tide apps or online tide tables.

##### Sun Direction and Angle

Before getting in to the water, check how shadows fall and where the sun is in relation to your planned travel direction.

##### Objects and Formations

It’s useful to note the position of reefs, piers, kelp beds, buoys and other objects so that you know where you are when you encounter them underwater.

##### Depth Finder

If you’re diving from a boat with a depth finder, you’ll be able to see a picture of the bottom. Depth finders can show you bottom contours, wrecks and reefs, all of which can be references

#### Descents

Maintaining your orientation as you descend. Start by orienting to your travel direction – know whether it’s to your right, left, ahead, etc.

#### Natural References

Once underwater, you orient yourself through a variety of natural references. Most common ones are:

##### Sun and Shadows

For example, at the start of a dive you note the sun is on your right and/or underwater shadows are to the left. If you get disoriented during the dive, turn so the sun’s on your right and shadows are to your left. This faces you in your original direction. Changes in light intensity can cue you to depth changes.

##### Water Motion

Be aware that currents can shift direction during a dive, especially when tides change.
Waves passing overhead cause surge. Surge is a reliable reference because the back-and-forth motion swings to and from shore or shallow areas. You feel it most strongly in shallow water. However, large swells can make surge noticeable in even relatively deep water. When diving in surge, note the water movement to determine the direction toward shore.

##### Bottom Composition and Formations

 Sand ripples are a good example; they form perpendicular to the water flow. In lakes and the ocean near a shoreline, sand ripples generally lie parallel to shore; by swimming perpendicular to the ripples, you’ll head toward or away from shore usually (easily judged by whether you’re getting deeper or shallower).

##### Bottom Contour

You can follow a natural slope toward deeper water; rock ridges, coral reefs, kelp beds and, in lakes, even sunken logs can form natural paths you can swim along. To follow a contour, simply keep the slope or other reference on your right or left.

##### Plants and Animals

Finding lots of fish over open sand may suggest a reef or habitat nearby.

##### Sound

### Compass Navigation

there are two kinds of compasses: the conventional analog compass and the electronic compass, which is usually built into a dive computer. Fundamentally, you use both the same way.
![[Pasted image 20230318221509.png]]
Precision analog compasses typically show degree headings in 30-degree increments, with smaller increments in between. Electronic dive compasses typically read the heading number digitally, often in one-degree increments (very precise).
Recall that the lubber line – actual or virtual – indicates your travel direction, and the bezel – again, actual or virtual – helps you hold a steady heading while swimming

- Hold your compass level, facing your travel direction.
- Align the lubber line – an imaginary line through the center of the compass, though it may be marked – squarely with your body centerline, pointed in your travel direction.
- Set the bezel by rotating it until the index marks straddle the needle. This provides a visual reference that you’re on course.
- To swim holding a heading, keep the compass centered with your body and travel along the lubber line (the needle always points north and the lubber line is always your travel direction) keeping the needle within the index marks.
If you turn from the desired direction, the needle leaves the index marks; turn back to re-center the needle between them. (*Red in the shed*)

#### Compass Use Tips
- Trust your compass.
- Use Natural References
- Practice on land
- Allow for the effects of currents
- Share responsibilities midwater: If you’re navigating in midwater, have one buddy read the compass and the other monitor depth.
- Use patterns
- Use intentional error on long distances
- Take your time, understand the limits and have fun with it
- Remeber the priority: Dive First, Situation Second & Communicate Third
### Using Navigation Patterns

You use your limited gas and bottom time more effectively when you use a pattern suited to the dive site. Out-and-back lines, squares/rectangles, triangles and circles are commonly used navigation patterns, each with its own characteristics.

#### Out-and-back Lines

Simplest and perhaps most common patterns. You follow a straight line out, then reverse course and follow the same (or a close parallel) line back to your exit. You may follow a compass heading or natural formations that are long and narrow – e.g. reef grooves, the side of a wreck, etc. – or a combination of these. When you reach turn pressure, you reverse and come back the way you came. You may do this several metres/feet to one side or the other if possible so you can spot some different features on the return.
![[Pasted image 20230318224043.png|400]]![[Pasted image 20230318224220.png|500]]

#### Squares & Rectangles

Three legs of a square/rectangle are usually the easiest way to navigate around an obstacle. You may or may not have to measure distance to get a useable pattern. To compass navigate a square or a rectangle, begin by setting a heading for the first side and swimming the desired distance – use kick cycles, time or cylinder pressure to measure. Rotate the bezel 90 degrees and turn to realign the needle within the index marks. In this case, your initial heading is 50°, followed by 140°, 230° and 320°:
![[Pasted image 20230318224517.png|500]]
Add 90 degrees for a right turn, or subtract 90 degrees for a left; this is also how to find your headings when using an electronic compass that shows only headings. When adding, due North is 0 degrees; when subtracting it is 360 degrees.

### Other Navigation Devices

GPS (Global Positioning System) is a challenge for underwater use, because the signals don’t penetrate water. To provide GPS-like convenience, however, a growing number of systems use a transponder hanging from a boat, buoy or dock. The transponder emits signals that diver-carried instruments (including some dive computers) use to track your relative position.
Even with electronic underwater navigation, for the immediate future there will be many circumstances in which these devices are impractical and/or unavailable. Therefore, natural navigation and compass navigation will likely remain important, useful dive skills for the foreseeable future.

## Deep Diving

With respect to recreational diving, a “deep dive” is a dive deeper than 18 metres/60 feet to an absolute maximum depth limit of 40 metres/130 feet.

### Your Depth Limits

Although 40 metres/130 feet is the maximum depth for recreational diving, 30 metres/100 feet is the recommended limit for Advanced Open Water Divers. Reasons being:

- Even with dive computers and using enriched air nitrox, the no stop time deeper than 30 metres/100 feet is very short.
- Most divers begin to find gas narcosis noticeable deeper than 30 metres/100 feet – staying shallower helps avoid narcosis problems.
- There’s an increased risk of decompression sickness because it is easier than in shallower diving to reach the no stop limits, yet not have enough gas for an adequate emergency decompression stop.
- in many environments, light and temperature fall dramatically with depth. Deeper than 30 metres/100 feet, darkness and cold may complicate diving

Time/distance to emergency assistance, proper first aid resources and medical treatment. The longer it would take to reach these, the shallower and more conservative you’ll want to plan your dive.
Proper deep diving objectives may include exploring the deep portion of a wreck, drift diving along a wall, photographing deep-water creatures, sightseeing and training/gaining experience to gradually extend your depth limit in a given environment.

### Equipment for Deep Diving

Optimal equipment for deep diving relates primarily to your regulator, alternate air source and cylinder.
The most popular alternate air sources are the extra second stage and the alternate inflator regulator, both of which are acceptable for recreational deep diving. Secure it as you learned as an entry-level diver: It should be visible and buddy-accessible in the triangle formed by your mouth and lower rib cage corners.
H-valves are alternate air source spinoffs from tec diving. They allow you to mount two independent regulators on a single cylinder. If you were to have a freeflow, you or a buddy could shut off the affected regulator, and you would ascend using the other.
Pony Bottle, which is a small cylinder – typically 2-4 litre/12-30 cubic foot, but sometimes larger – with its own regulator. It provides additional gas, and you can use it to rescue yourself in an out-of-gas emergency.
![[Pasted image 20230319132417.png|300]]
Wet suit compresses and loses some of its ability to insulate as you go deeper. This isn’t always a major issue, but one advantage of most (but not all) types of dry suits is that they have little insulation loss with depth.

Useful in deep diving:

- Reference Line
- Dive light
- First-aid kit and emergency oxygen
- Extra gas supply: Could be carried or staged (suspended from a boat - like pic below)
![[Pasted image 20230319132615.png|300]]
- Extra weights

On a deep dive note that no stop time is more likely to limit your dive time than is your gas supply (but watch both, of course).
Use your computer to stay within no stop (no decompression) limits. In recreational diving, required decompression should be an emergency situation only.
Computers use a mathematical model to estimate theoretical nitrogen based on depth and time information. Although highly reliable, mathematical models are not perfect and cannot account for individual differences. This is why no dive computer or dive table can guarantee that decompression sickness will never occur, even within model limits. It’s also why you dive conservatively, well within the computer’s limits.

### Deep Diving Techniques: Buddy Contact, Weighting and Buoyancy, Descents and Ascents

The rule of thumb is to search no longer than a minute for your buddy, then reunite on the surface. On a deep dive, buddy separation often ends the dive because you don’t have enough gas and no stop time to find each other and then continue the dive.

#### Buoyancy

you should begin a dive properly weighted – that is, in all your gear and with an empty BCD, you should float at eye level holding a normal breath and sink slowly when you exhale. Add two kilograms/five pounds after adjusting if you check with a full cylinder. Depending upon your exposure suit, you may experience more buoyancy loss on a deep dive as the material compresses and loses buoyancy, but don’t use less weight as a result or you’ll likely be too buoyant at the end of the dive to make an effective safety stop.

#### Descent & Ascent

if you have to descend without the bottom in sight, it may help to descend with your head above your feet. That’s because this position reduces vertigo and helps you stay oriented (and many divers find they can equalize more easily).
Try to grab the line as you descend. If you cant because your hands are occupied: wrap your elbow or your legs to the line.
Ascend no faster than the rate specified by your computer, or 18 metres/60 feet per minute, whichever is slower. Watch your computer to confirm a proper rate, but most can be set to provide audible alarms so you can monitor your ascent without looking – if you hear it, you know to slow your rate.
Watch overhead as you ascend, and listen for boats. Make a three-minute (or longer) safety stop at 5 metres/15 feet (or depth specified by the computer manufacturer). Reach up and turn, or look around, as you near the surface for the final part of your ascent.

### Deep Diving Techniques: Breathing and Gas Use, Eanx and Wall Dives

The deeper you are, the denser the gas, which increases the energy required to breathe. The faster you breathe, the more energy you use. Trying to breathe rapidly (such as due to strenuous activity) can make you feel air starved – like the regulator can’t deliver enough gas.
Effective breathing, as you learned, is deep, slow and efficient breathing from the abdomen. Breathing this way fills your lungs from the bottom up, which gives the best gas exchange with the least energy used. It is the most relaxed breathing; breathing this way helps you maintain optimal breathing techniques.
Check your remaining gas supply frequently. The deeper you are, the more often you should check it.
Determine your gas consumption rate at the surface in litres per minute with this formula:
	bar used x cylinder volume (litres)/actual bottom time x pressure at depth (bar)
	![[Pasted image 20230319140739.png|400]]

#### Enriched Air Nitrox (EANx)

EANx is air with an increased proportion of oxygen and a decreased proportion of nitrogen, which can benefit deep dives because you have significantly longer no stop times – the higher the oxygen and the lower the nitrogen, the more no stop time at a given depth. Even if your dive is limited by gas, EANx decreases the residual nitrogen you accumulate, making repetitive dives longer.
The primary drawback to EANx is that you have to manage oxygen exposure – the higher the oxygen content, the shallower the maximum useable depth. For example, diving with EANx32 (32 percent oxygen), the maximum depth is 33 metres/110 feet. With EANx36 (36 percent oxygen), it’s 28 metres/95 feet.

#### Wall Dives

3 guidelines:

- Watch your depth closely and control your buoyancy – it’s easy to exceed depth limits and/or your planned depth. If a current begins to push you down the wall (downwelling), put air into your BCD and swim directly away from the wall until free of the current, then readjust your buoyancy.
- Stay next to the wall to provide a visual reference and reduce vertigo.
- Don’t stay too close to the wall, though. Many walls are habitats for sensitive aquatic life.

### Deep Diving Techniques: Safety Stops, Emergency Decompression Stops

Safety stops reduce your risk of decompression illness by giving your body extra time to release excess dissolved nitrogen before surfacing. Stopping also helps you establish proper buoyancy control before going through the final 5 metres/15 feet

1. If you exceed the no stop (no decompression) limit by no more than five minutes, make an eight-minute stop at 5 metres/15 feet. Do not dive again for at least six hours.
2. If you exceed the no stop (no decompression) limit by more than five minutes, make a stop at 5 metres/15 feet for at least 15 minutes (gas supply allowing) and do not dive for at least 24 hours.
3. If unable to make the requisite safety stop: After surfacing, notify your buddies and breathe emergency oxygen if available as soon as possible. Monitor yourself for decompression sickness symptoms.
**Safety stop** - is optional, best practice and usually 3 mins.
**Emergency decompression stop** - when you exceed no stop limit, required to prevent decompression sickness. Time depends on tables &/or dive computer.

### Gas Narcosis

Gas narcosis (sometimes less properly called “nitrogen narcosis”) is the narcotic property that results from breathing air or enriched air nitrox under pressure. The exact cause isn’t fully understood, but has been linked to the absorption of gas into the nerve cell structure, interfering with normal nervous system transmission. All gases, including nitrogen and oxygen, are thought to cause narcosis if they penetrate the cell lipid (fat) structure in sufficient concentration.
Narcosis is a variable physiological phenomenon. This means its intensity varies from one person to another, and within the same person from day to day. Most divers feel narcosis at approximately 30 metres/100 feet to 40 metres/130 feet, but can still perform routine tasks (buoyancy control, etc.). However, the ability to handle a stressful, new or complex situation may be impaired; you may not notice its effects until attempting something that requires concentration or fine coordination.
Sometimes divers experience narcosis shallower than approximately 30 metres/100 feet, and one cause can be certain drugs or alcohol, which combine with narcosis and make it more noticeable
If narcosis occurs, don’t ignore it. If it becomes a factor, ascend to a shallower depth. It will normally subside on its own with no aftereffects.

### Decompression Sickness

decompression sickness (DCS) is a serious medical condition that results when nitrogen dissolved into body tissues during a dive comes out of solution faster than the body can eliminate it safely, resulting in the formation of bubbles within tissues. Depending on where they form, these bubbles can cause pain, paralysis and, in extreme cases, death.
![[Pasted image 20230319145018.png|250]]
Diver errors leading to DCS include misuse of (or not using) dive computers/tables, exceeding proper ascent rates, omitting emergency decompression stops, disregarding factors that predispose you to DCS, and failure to follow conservative diving practices (like staying well within computer/table limits). Running out of gas can also contribute by leading to rapid ascents and/or skipping emergency decompression stops.
DCS symptoms include:

- Pain, often in the limbs and also often (but not necessarily) in the joints. The pain can change location and intensity over time.
- Numbness, tingling or paralysis
- Unusual fatigue or weakness
- Skin itch
- Shortness of breath
- Dizziness and vertigo
In most cases, DCS occurs at the surface within one to two hours of the dive, though it can occur underwater at a shallow depth, or can be delayed as long as 48 hours.

Several factors are thought to predispose a diver to DCS:

- Dehydration
- Excess fat & poor fitness
- Age
- Heavy exertion immediately before, during or after a deep dive
- Injuries or illness
- Alcohol use
- Cold water
- Hot showers or baths immediately after a dive
- Carbon dioxide increase
- Exposure to altitude

Follow these steps if a diver is suspected of DCS:

- Have the diver lie down and breathe 100 percent oxygen if available. The diver may lie on the side or face up, but should avoid sitting up because this can make symptoms worse.
- In severe cases, a patient who has no breathing and no signs of circulation will need CPR. The patient must be face up on a firm surface for chest compressions.
- Put an unresponsive breathing diver in the recovery position, left side down.

Medical treatment usually requires putting the diver back under pressure in a recompression chamber. Recompression reduces the bubbles and forces them into solution. Accompanied by oxygen, drug therapy and fluids, treatment brings the diver back to surface pressure at a slow (typically several hours), controlled rate.
 Do not put a diver with suspected DCI back into the water, for several reasons.
 - Recompression often requires extreme pressure – the equivalent of 50 metres/165 feet
 - Treatments may also take six to 10 hours, longer than a diver can reasonably endure heat loss even in very warm water, assuming there is sufficient gas for such duration.

## Peak Performance Buoyancy

Tucking everything in and perfecting my weight made me more streamlined. Now I don’t tire out as easily from finning hard, and I use a lot less gas.

### Buoyancy Basics – Proper Weighting

Peak performance buoyancy is the mark of an accomplished diver. It consists of proper weighting, trim, buoyancy adjustment and streamlining.

- Proper weighting means diving with the correct amount of weight.
- Trim means distributing your weight and equipment for a natural, comfortable balance in the water.
- Buoyancy adjustment means using your BCD or dry suit, and breathing during the dive, to accommodate buoyancy changes caused by depth changes and gas consumption.
- Streamlining means your scuba kit is compact with nothing dangling, dragging or protruding inappropriately.

Your BCD can offset having too much weight, but overweighting raises your torso, lowers your feet, increases drag and magnifies your buoyancy adjustments. Too little weight means you struggle to stay down, which increases your air consumption. It gets progressively worse during the dive, and may make it difficult to control your ascent rate or make an effective safety stop.
![[Pasted image 20230320095939.png|625]]
Buoyancy weight check steps:

1. Enter water too deep in which to stand, wearing all your gear and the estimated weight from the basic guidelines.
2. Breathing from your regulator, completely deflate your BCD. If you’re diving in a dry suit, open the auto exhaust valve all the way.
3. Relax in a vertical position holding a normal breath at the surface. If you’re weighted properly, you should float at eye level.
4. Add or subtract weight until you float at eye level. It helps to simply hold weights while you figure it out.
5. As a final check, you should sink slowly when you exhale.

From full to reserve, gas in the popular 11-litre/80-cubic-foot cylinder is about two kilograms/five pounds – your buoyancy will increase this much during the dive.

### Buoyancy Basics – Controlling Buoyancy during the Dive

There are three variables that make buoyancy adjustment necessary:

- Suit compression
- Gas usage
- Depth change - This variable relates to suit compression, but also to gas you add to your BCD/dry suit.
 Control your buoyancy by anticipating changes, especially changes in depth. Make small, frequent adjustments to your buoyancy as you dive, and maintain neutral buoyancy by adjusting when you notice small buoyancy changes.

Use your fins and breathing to change depth. If you’re maintaining neutral buoyancy, a kick should start you upward, or exhaling should start you downward.
Breathe with somewhat fuller or emptier lungs for short intervals to temporarily raise or lower your buoyancy, respectively. If you need to do this for more than a moment, then you probably need to adjust your BCD/dry suit. Never hold your breath

### Trim

Trim refers to your attitude and position underwater. You may have the correct amount of weight, but it is your trim that determines where you wear it.
Most generally useful trim is for a horizontal swimming position.
You don’t have to be able to quick-release and drop all your weight in an emergency, just enough to assure you’re positively buoyant.

### Streamlining

Streamlining is reducing drag by eliminating protruding and dangling equipment.
Benefits:

- Makes your kicks more efficient
- More comfortable
- Saves energy by reducing drag
- Reduces damage to your gear and to the environment

Everything has the correct fit, and is adjusted correctly. Your scuba kit rides high and tight on your back.
Your hoses are clipped and secured. Your SPG is high on your chest to take up hose slack, and your alternate second stage is secured, but visible, and quick-releases with a firm tug.
Everything stays put when you change position. When you have everything properly secured and streamlined, it doesn’t move much.

### Physical Fitness
- An out-of-shape diver has less strength and stamina
- Lean mass (muscle) sinks and fat tissue floats
- out-of-shape diver has more bulk, and is less streamlined

## Drift Diving

Drift diving is diving with the current instead of against it. It is any form of diving in mild to heavy current in which your exit point is significantly down-current from your entry. Rather than have to swim or pull yourself into the current, you let it give you a ride.

best suited to long, extensive bottom topography, such as a reef, river or a series of closely spaced sites.
Advantages:

- expend relatively little energy – you don’t swim much or at all during most of the dive.
- enables you to dive where it would otherwise be difficult, impossible or hazardous due to current.
- generally cover a wide area and see a lot of the reef.
- with many types of drift diving, you don’t have to find a particular exit point, which simplifies navigation.
Concerns:
- timing is important, because drift diving requires divers to coordinate entries, exits, descents and ascents.
- if your buddy stops, and you’re not aware of it, the current can separate you very quickly.
- you commonly need some form of surface supervision (usually from a boat)

### Current Characteristics

Many forces cause currents including tides, wind, gravity and the earth’s rotation.
It’s exhausting to swim against anything but a very mild current – usually less than 1/2 knot for most divers – and current speed is usually slower near the bottom than at the surface because of resistance with the bottom.
Keep in mind that divers closer to the bottom will often drift more slowly than those well above it, because current usually slows near the bottom because of drag. this can affect keeping a group together.

### Types of Drift Diving
- with a surface float
- without a surface float
- with DSMBs (delayed surface marker buoys) - most common
	- these are the buoys that dive masters inflate underwater to alert boat traffic
Always have surface support figured out when drift diving (usually its a boat keeping track of divers underneath)

### Drift Diving Equipment

DSMBs are usually deployed using tec-diving-type reels with #36 braided nylon line. For drift diving with a towed surface float, use 4-12-millimetre/1/8-1/2-inch nylon or polypropylene line, which is a manageable, visible size that divers can use to guide descents/ascents.
You should have at least one visual and one audible surface signaling device.
For night drift dives, flares and emergency lights make you visible.
Whistles for sound

### Techniques & Procedures
- lower visibility and a faster current make it more advantageous to dive in several smaller teams rather than one large group.
- Drift diving entries take more coordination than non-drift entries. The most important factor is for divers to be ready together so they can enter together. Otherwise, the current can separate everyone – buddies, or a group – quickly.

Buddy teams or groups diving together begin a drift dive either floating together before descending together, or immediately descending together.

- Buoyant entries - common to hang on to a line deployed from the boat until everyone’s ready. good choice when the drift area’s large and there’s no issue delaying the descent a bit.
- Negative entries. Divers enter with their BCDs deflated and descend without time on the surface. This means everyone must enter and descend together. It’s a good technique when the dive must begin at a very specific point, or when surface conditions are rough.

If necessary to stop or slow (e.g., to let some of the group catch up with the leader), swim gently into the current, duck behind something out of the current, or hang on to a nonliving part of the reef.

Direction changes usually involve swimming across the current to avoid or intercept something. To avoid having to fight the current, start your swim before you reach your target.

### Hazards & Problems
#### Getting Lost

Unless the group agrees to a different procedure during dive planning, if lost (separated), search for no more than a minute before ascending to the surface.

#### Overexertion

Overexertion (exhaustion) is the primary hazard when diving in currents. Its signs and symptoms include fatigue, labored breathing, a feeling of suffocation, headache, muscle cramping and a tendency to panic.
Avoid overexertion underwater. Don’t try to fight the current, and stay well within your physical limits.
Underwater, duck out of the current or hang on to something on the bottom (avoiding sensitive organisms). If you can’t do this, ascend at a safe rate, inflate your BCD, rest and signal the boat to pick you up. Swim across the current if you can reach a current line.

#### Psychological Stress

In drift diving, like all diving, stay within your psychological and physical limits, and gain experience slowly. Tell your instructor how you feel, especially if you feel stressed.

Ecology is the study of living things and their interrelationships with each other and their environments.
An ecosystem is a natural system functioning together, including all inanimate and animate components. Each ecosystem has its own climate and life adapted to it.
Density is one of the principle differences between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Water is about 800 times denser than air, so it takes more energy to move through water. Only the fastest terrestrial animals must be streamlined; all but the slowest aquatic animals are streamlined.
Another difference deals with fluid motion. Relatively few terrestrial animals use air-born reproductive strategies, like plants use pollen – but, this is the most common strategy among animals as well as plants in aquatic ecosystems. Almost no terrestrial animals rely entirely on air movement to bring food or to carry them to food, but many aquatic animals rely on water movement to get nourishment.
Most terrestrial ecosystems have adequate light to support plant life. Only relatively shallow aquatic ecosystems have plant (or algae) life. Air doesn’t significantly affect light properties, other than absorbing ultraviolet light. Water absorbs and scatters light over short distances, so that light is not a significant energy source even at depths that still have visible light.
All terrestrial organisms deal with gravity. Because of this, terrestrial organisms have rigid support structures (fiber, wood, bone, cartilage, etc.).
Buoyancy in water offsets gravity, so it affects aquatic organisms less, or almost not at all. In fact, many aquatic organisms have no rigid support structures. The largest organisms live in the oceans. Entire ecosystems (e.g., plankton) live suspended in water.
Water has less oxygen and it is unevenly distributed; shallow-water environments may have more oxygen than deeper water. Many aquatic organisms have gills, which are significantly more efficient than lungs at gathering oxygen.
plants tend to dominate terrestrial ecosystems, thanks to rigid structures that combat gravity. They are often massive and difficult to move, making plant eco systems stable and long-lived compared to aquatic plant ecosystems. Long-lived plant communities control short-lived animal communities. We tend to describe terrestrial ecosystems in plant terms and geological terms: tropical rain forest, grassland, snow forest, tundra, desert, etc.
On the flip side, animals tend to dominate aquatic ecosystems. Most plants – including algae, which are not technically plants – tend to be small and primarily microscopic. Small aquatic animals consume small aquatic plants, bringing plant energy into the ecosystem. More than terrestrial ecosystems, aquatic ecosystems are often described in animal terms: coral reef, oyster beds, clam beds, etc. (There are exceptions, such as kelp forests.)
Terrestrial ecosystems tend to have shorter food chains, because they include large animals that eat stable plant food sources directly. Aquatic ecosystems tend to have longer food chains, because more often small animals eat small aquatic plants; and increasingly larger animals consume smaller ones, passing energy up the food chain.
The most common cause of “attacks” is when an animal exhibits defensive behavior. The organism perceives a need to defend itself, its territory, its mate or its young.
Descend so that you don’t reach the bottom with your feet directly below you. Transition to a horizontal swimming position well above the bottom. Swim without kicking up sand or silt. This preserves the visibility.

## Fish Identification

Scientists estimate there are more than 21,000 fish species globally, more than 4000 of which are found on coral reefs.
To identify fish, you look for common characteristics that let you categorize them into 12 groups that represent 30 to 50 families. With practice, you learn to focus on the most common and representative species of different families.

Water pressure changes 1bar (atmospheric pressure) every 10m. So at 10m pressure is 2bar etc. Air volume reduces to 1/N and density increases by N (where N is pressure in bar) .

Equalize every meter or so: Pinch your nose and blow through ear. For mask breathe out through nose into mask.

Most important rule: Always breathe continuously and never hold your breath.

Check BWRAF: BCD, Weight, Release, Air, Final Check

Ascend no faster than 18m/min though most dive computers max at 10m/min

Safety Stop: Pause at around 4-6m depth for 3-5 mins to let body tissues adjust back from the compression/pressure

SPG (submersible pressure gauge) tells you how much air is left in your cylinder

You should float at eye level with an empty BCD & holding a normal breath. You will sink when you exhale. After adjustment add 2kg/5lb to compensate for emptying cylinder.

To clear snorkel, blow hard into it (blast method). Then breathe in slow & cautiously.

When neutrally buoyant, you should pivot upward during inhale & downward during exhale.

Low Pressure Inflator??

Always monitor your SPG to know how much air left within 20bar/300psi

Thermocline: Border between the warmer upper layer and colder lower layer of water

Currents tend to be weaker near the bottom. Waves break at spots where water is only slightly deeper than the wave height itself.

Longshore Current

Rip Current

Always establish buoyancy first when you get to the surface (like life jacket)

4 ways to ascend when low on air:

1. Make normal ascent right where you air. Breathe lightly & continuously.
2. Ascend using alternate air source from buddy
3. Make Controlled Emergency [[swimming]] Ascent: Swim upwards, don’t drop weights and make continuous “ahhh” sound in regulator to avoid lung over expansion.
4. Make buoyant emergency ascent: (Most risky option) Drop weights and swim up rapidly making “ahhh” sound. Will probably exceed safe ascent rate so risk lung expansion.

Log: Date, Dive Site (name & location), Dive buddies, Dive depth & duration, Objective/description

Air: 79% Nitrogen & 21% Oxygen

Never dive with 100% oxygen (only ten divers), it is toxic deeper than 6m. EANx (enriches air has higher than 21% O2)

Trace contaminants (like carbon monoxide & oil vapor) that are fine on the surface may be toxic when breathed under pressure.

Decompression Sickness (“bends”): Nitrogen gets absorbed in body tissue while diving and naturally gets released over time through breaths, after surfacing. Though sometimes the lungs can’t get the Nitrogen out faster than it is being released from tissues causing bubbles near the joints. This is very dangerous! Depends on depth (pressure) & time under water.

RDP -> recreational dive planner

Recreational diving is “No Stop Diving”: Maximum time you can spend at a given depth and still ascend to surface without stopping (without unacceptable risk of DCS).

Flying after diving: 12 hrs for regular no stop dives & 18 hrs for repetitive dives, or back to back diving days.

Decompression Illness (DCI): Includes both lung over expansion and decompression sickness,.even though they’re caused by different reasons they have similar symptoms.

Gas narcosis : Breathing gases under pressure (~30m depth) has an intoxicating effect. It is thought to be caused by increased ZSw dissolved gases in body tissues slowing nerve impulses that travel in the brain & nervous system. Drunkenness, anxiety, depression, slowed thinking.
