- Photos should look timeless
- Great light - shoot early in the morning or sunsets
	- Or interesting light patterns
- Should tell a story - whats going on with the people in the picture? how did they get there? what are they doing?

[Fuji X100F Tutorial - Best Settings - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIhbqc2UWgs)
Recommended settings
	- Shutter Speed : 125 - 500
	- ISO : 800 - 1000
		 - some people swear by 400 or even 200 on bright days. ISO looks different on different cameras
		 - L - 100, H - 25600+ (not recommended), A for auto
	- 23mm Lens - still fixed but prime lens so super fast. f/2.0 gives super shallow depth of field
	- For street : f/5.6 and for portraits 2.0 or 2.8
		 - After 8 not enough light in and loses that cinematic quality
	- Focus ring
	- C is not the greatest focus mode on this camera
	- Film simulation : Classic Chrome (filmy) or Pro Neg Std (good on skin/portraits),
		 - Vivid if you dont want to modify the images offline (way too saturated & contrasty). looks best out of camera
	- For quick shots: use auto shutter speed and auto ISO
	- For Portraits: use very low ISO

#goal_long_term - Pick an area of SF like Japantown and photograph it in different ways: may be post it to a specific insta handle

#goal_long_term - Film a long road trip with Insta360 or GoPro and upload to youtube as a vr video: similar to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=my19xg3u3HA). May be for the [[alaskan highway]]
