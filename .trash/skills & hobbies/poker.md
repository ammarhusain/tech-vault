1. Royal Flush: (Odds of getting it ~ 1/650k)
	10, J, Q, K, A all of same suit ...

2. Straight Flush: (Odds are ~1/72798)
	All 5 sequential cards of the same suit ... 5,6,7,8 etc. Cannot be a wrap around like K,A,2,3 ... Higher card value is the bigger hand.

3. Four of a kind: (Odds ~1/4164)
	Four kinds are of the same rank, one from each suit. Fifth card does not matter. Higher ranking 4 cards wins.

4. Full House: (Odds ~ 1/693)
	Three of a kind + Two of a kind (3 cards of same rank with different suits + 2 cards of same rank with different suits). Ties are broken first by the numerical rank of the 3 cards then by looking at the pair.

5. Flush: (Odds ~ 1/508)
	Five cards all of the same suit. Don't have to be sequential. Highest ranking card within the flush wins

6. Straight: (Odds ~1/255)
	Five cards in numerical order regardless of suit. Player with higher ranking card wins.

7. Three of a kind: (Odds ~ 1/46)
	Three cards of same numerical rank. Other 2 cards don't matter. If 2 cards were same then becomes a Full House.

8. Two Pair: (Odds ~ 1/20)
	Two pairs of cards of the same numerical rank. Last card does not matter.

9. One Pair: (Odds ~ 1/4)
	One pair of cards with the same numerical rank, aka two of a kind. Other 3 cards don't matter.

10. High Card:
	Whoever has the highest single card. Not really much of a hand.

Ante is the starting bet that every player puts in the pot.
