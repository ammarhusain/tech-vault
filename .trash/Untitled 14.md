**Transport**

About moving around in Brazil: We did everything by bus. The bus network is very good, modern busses, reliable, and safe. They also make frequent (food) stops. And its affordable.

**Rio**

Toby: We loved this city! One of the most picturesque places - and very diverse. You can go hiking in the jungle in the morning and enjoy some Caipis in the afternoon at the beach without crossing the city limits. Has some sketchy areas of course but Ipanema and Copacapana are mostly safe (during daylight).

  

  

**Ilha Grande**

Toby - Tropical island, close to Rio! You can get there by bus in 4 hours. Tropical forests, empty beaches - really stunning. There is only one small town on the island, quite touristy but you could work from there, there is enough infrastructure. Also, we went diving there. It was alright but not the best. Highly recommended to spend some days on the island, if you have time.

  

**S√£o Paulo**

Toby - Well... an enormous city. There are a few nice neighborhoods (e.g., **Vila Madalena**) but besides that, there is not too much to do. The big avenue is nice, especially on Sundays (car free). There are a few parks which are nice too and the Japanese neighborhood is also worth a visit. Great Sushi and Pizza! But the old part of the city is quite run down and there are many addicts around. But you are from SF, so maybe you feel right at home there.. ü§ê It's not safe to walk there after sunset or on weekends and I would be very careful anytime of the day.

  

Since you want to spend most of your time here - I would advice against that. Maybe visit for a weekend (if even) but everywhere else I liked it more in Brazil.

  

Towns near S√£o Paulo: **Caraguatatuba** or **Santos**

  

**Paraty**

Toby - Super nice old colonial town. Very touristy, especially on weekends. There are some nice beaches around as well. The old town is definitely worth a visit. All in all, great to stop if you pass through the area but its quite small. I would not spend more than a day or two here. Could be nice to work from as well, since its quiet (for Brazilian standards).

  

**Pantanal**

Toby - That area is amazing, if you have the chance to visit - do it! There are a few things to consider though. First, there is a northern and southern section. While the northern is more "wild" and the wildlife is better, the southern is better accessible and cheaper. In the northern part, there are more Resorts were you stay for a week while in the southern part are more farms where you can stay. We stayed on a farm and it was a unique and amazing experience. Wildlife everywhere! I am happy to share details if you consider to go there. We started from Campo Grande. Pantanal has a bigger bio diversity than the Amazon!

  

**Foz do Igua√ßu**

Toby - The famous waterfalls, a must-see if you are in the area. You can visit the Argentinian side as well (day trip). And you can go shopping in Paraguay (Ciudad del Este), just walk over the bridge! Nice to stop in Foz do Igua√ßu for a few days, but the town itself is not exciting.

  

Ammar‚Äôs thoughts - let‚Äôs skip maybe - can go here where when we go to Argentina - it‚Äôs possible to get here from Buenos Aires

  

**Florian√≥polis**

Toby - This is an absolute gem. Its a "city" but its spread out over the entire island. You will find many towns with lush rainforests, hill, secluded beaches, and cliffs in between. There are many outdoor activities you can do here and its just beautiful. And not very touristy... at least tourist do not concentrate on one single place. Different towns have different vibes (luxurious, hippie, ...). We stayed here in a Hostel that has digital nomads as their target customers with high speed internet and dedicated office areas - I am happy to share details.

If you‚Äôre exploring the city in daylight, head directly to Casco Viejo, the dining and entertainment hotspot. It‚Äôs the second-most visited place in Panama after the canal and the area is a pleasure to discover on foot. Everything is conveniently located within walking distance: hotels, chic eateries, ice cream parlors, quaint cafes, churches, historical squares and shops. While here, get the quintessential souvenir, a Panama hat, from Victor‚Äôs Panama Hats or buy souvenirs and trinkets from indigenous Kuna women at the outdoor stalls in Plaza de la Independencia or along Paseo Estaban Huertas, a seafront walkway with a bougainvillea canopy that offers great views of the Bridge of the Americas.

From Casco Viejo you can take a stroll to Cinta Costera, a scenic walkway and park that goes along the Bay of Panama. On this palm tree-lined promenade, you'll find picnics, joggers, an open-air gym, the iconic kaleidoscopic Panama sign, and tons of fresh air. Cinta Costera stretches from Casco Viejo to Punta Paitilla and essentially links the old town with the new.

  

For nature lovers, Panama City is blessed with two tropical forests where you‚Äôll spot monkeys, sloths, keel-billed toucans, and agoutis (called¬†_√±eques_¬†here) if luck is on your side. Take a taxi to Cerro Ancon or Parque Natural Metropolitano for sweeping panoramic views after a brisk hike of around 40 minutes each. From the top of Cerro Ancon (Ancon Hill), you can see Panama City's impressive juxtaposition of new and old with Casco Viejo on your right, and the skyscrapers of ‚Äúnew Panama‚Äù on your left.

A layover in Panama City can easily be combined with a beach trip. Though Panama‚Äôs capital is a waterfront city, it‚Äôs along a bay, and there are no beaches within the city. However, there‚Äôs one 20 minutes away by taxi in Veracruz, where you‚Äôll find numerous beachside bars‚Äîcheck out Praia, Veri Veri and Panorama‚Äîselling fresh seafood.¬†

Isla Taboga, the ‚ÄúIsland of the Flowers,‚Äù is also just 30 minutes away from the city by ferry. The Taboga Express ferry departs from Panama between 8am and 4:30pm. The first ferry back from Taboga is at 8:45am and the last is at 4pm. Return tickets cost $20.
