Here’s a description of the Whispered Ah procedure: [Notes on using the Whispered 'Ah' Procedure | Hilary King, MSTAT](https://www.hilaryking.net/alexander-technique/notes-on-using-the-whispered-ah-procedure)

Here’s the book I mentioned on breathing: [MRJAMESNESTOR Breath book](https://www.mrjamesnestor.com/breath) Many interesting videos on that website. 

You can go down a huge internet rabbit hole over tongue posture and I couldn’t find a lot of scientific evidence, but as a general rule of thumb (tongue), you might (key is might) be more comfortable with the tongue lightly resting against the upper palate, emphasize the word rest, no pressure. Try not to do it. you could imagine your tongue like a cloud gently floating there and see what happens to your head position, breathing and neck tension.

If you’d like to read a book on the AT, I recommend Thinking Aloud by Walter Carrington, or Alexander Technique, a Skill for Life by Pedro de Alcantara.

There are a range of videos on youtube from terrible to great, but it’s always interesting to watch those directly trained by FM Alexander. You could look up Alexander Technique + Marjory Barlow, or Marjorie Barstow, or Walter Carrington, or Erika Whittaker, or Patrick MacDonald, or Elizabeth Walker.

Here are your practice goals:

- Don't try too hard
- Soft Focus
- Drop chin, let neck be loose, stretching before working
- Undoing hunch
- Let breath be easy
- Work less on exhale
- Feel the pressure of the floor on your feet and float
- Not trying to breathe, just letting it be

I think your goals nicely summarize the theme of our class.

Techniques for "doing less" include:

- Panoramic Vision: Mountain/Ocean
- Double breath and a sigh (calms alarm reaction in nervous system),
- Phrases like, "I don't care, this is just a silly exercise", or, "Sometimes you just have to say, what the heck!" Feel free to substitute your own more colorful phrase.
- Stopping to pause and feel how your feet are meeting the floor
- Allowing the neck to melt and the head to float up
- Thinking of the body as a whole vs trying to focus on parts
- Connecting to ease in the body vs the problem area
- Pause

If you’d like to see some visual examples of masterful AT hands on work with performers, I recommend these videos:  [Introduction to the Alexander Technique: Marjorie Barstow - YouTube](https://youtu.be/NdrP_XGEuWI)

Here's a link to the rib animation video:
[Jessica Wolf's Art of Breathing demo - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apFui6-ffnM)
I've also attached a short article on the AT perspective on breathing. Please read it.

Here are your practice goals:

- Go fully into where the body feels most at ease
- Expand the back and armpits while inhaling
- Breathe Horizontally
- Being aware of the parts of body that isn't in pain
- I will work on not sticking out my chin more, so can let my body open up and move to use in scene work
- Let your rib cage expand horizontally when breathing
- Pay more attention to my ankle joint while moving

To get the fullest breath exhale completely and simply wait for the breath to return vs working to breath deeply. Next week we will do some movement exploration that will encourage the breath to move in different directions in the body.

If you remember the breath stretch from our first few weeks of class (move with pleasure ease and simplicity, expand fingers and palms of hands as you stretch arms away from body, and let hands close as you bring arms in, move spine in all 6 directions, then pause to "resonate", that is, notice the effects). See if the breath stretch helps you feel breath more freely.

There is a difference between controlling the breath to create changes in the nervous system (like our double breath and sigh), or other "pranayama" practices from yoga, and the AT process of allowing the breath to come and go on it's own.

For performance you need a mixture of controlled breath and free natural breath, but initially what happens when everyone works with the breath is a lot of tension and interference, so we start with allowing the breath to come and go on it's own. It's helpful to carry the belief that the breath has a natural intelligence and if you don't interfere it will do what you need it to to perfectly balance and integrate both body, mind, emotion and spirit.

Also remember our new AT direction: I allow my ribs to move on my spine with the breath. You can also think, I allow my belly to soften.

[[2021-10-19-Tuesday]]

Goals:

- I will work on adjusting my brand-new arches in my foot!
- A more balanced movement diet
- Three Penny Tripod beneath my foot
- Allow your hands and feet to discover innocently
- Work on balancing on my whole foot, and allowing back to widen
- Do not “pre-tense” the hands and feet while reaching out for something or walking
- Be balanced on tripods of feet
- Think about the three points of my foot, where am I standing on them
- Focusing on the tripod of my foot

Seems like the work with the feet was enlightening!

Some further tips. Be sure not to push the three points down. Instead, free your ankles and bring your body weight over the whole foot so the points press down on their own. If you press them down it will cause an activation of the leg associated with pushing the ground away, which is only appropriate if that is the action that you are doing. Standing doesn’t have much “pushing” the ground away.  Pushing would be jumping, rising up on your toes, climbing up stairs or your back foot pushing off in walking/running.

The foot pronates (arch flattens) when you bend your legs, and supinates (arch lifts) when you unbend your legs. During these actions all three points of the tripod must stay down. If you are only on one or two points, the foot gets into very unstable situations (called eversion or inversion), which can lead to sprained ankles and balance issues, as well as stiffness, breath holding, jaw tightness and a range of other issues all the way up the skeleton.

Note that supination and pronation are rotational movement that involves the middle of the foot (between the heel and balls) twisting, and also other rotations all the way up the body. If the arches don’t twist and change shape, look for that rotation elsewhere (like the knees or hips). The body is like a hose. If one area doesn’t move and blocks flow, the water will escape elsewhere.

**Recap:**

We looked at Alexander's direction to let the back lengthen and widen from the perspective undoing. A shortened, narrowed back, or a twisted back is a back that is stuck in one or more of the 6 possible directions that the spine moves. These are: sagittal plane: 1) flexion or 2) extension, frontal plane: 3) bending left, 4) bending right, transverse plane: 5) twisting left or 6) twisting right).
Article - [Sagittal, Frontal and Transverse Body Planes: Exercises & Movements](https://blog.nasm.org/exercise-programming/sagittal-frontal-traverse-planes-explained-with-exercises)

If you view the spine as a hose full of flowing water, you can imagine an inefficient posture as the hose frozen mid-motion and your body stuck in one of the above shapes. Coming into a more neutral balanced posture is a matter of melting out of a frozen shape.

We also looked at the knees releasing away from the pelvis, and experienced how that affected breath - via the attachment of the psoas muscle to the legs and diaphragm. [Here's a very cool (but also highly detailed) article about the psoas and diaphragm](https://www.anatomytrains.com/blog/2013/01/20/cobra/)

Next week, I will give you a few landmarks to identify what a lengthened and widened back looks like. I withheld that information because I don't want you to think of achieving a static posture. The back is always moving in and out of arching, curling, bending and twisting. Nevertheless, I will provide the landmarks next week.

**Directions:**
  ***Neck free, to let the head move forward and up, to let the back lengthen and widen, to allow the knees to go forward and away from the hips, to allow the shoulders to expand to the sides***.

Directing is the process of thinking, wishing, ordering, projecting or seeing the above series of movements. Although directing may cause physical change, it is important to try not to “do” the directions. The key words are "let", or "allow". Physical changes may occur as a result of directing, but the main focus is the thought.

**Homework:**

Here are your key practice ideas:

- Having a wide back means letting go and "undoing".
- Arrows coming out of the knees
- Let your knees move away from your pelvic bone
- Lengthening the thighs
- Sending the knees away
- Allow support from my full foot!
- I want to work on allowing the arch in my lower back and pay more attention to allowing my back to elongate
- Relax the middle of my back to embody my character
- Opening up the back

**Specific Feedback from coaching**

- Shake out feet and focus on relaxing feet and toes. How does that affect breathing and balance, when singing and in other situations? Notice foot tension and position in everyday life. Have a foot awareness week.
- As you play with embodying your character's arched uprightness, imagine your spine as flowing water, moving into a shape versus holding a shape

Here are your goals to work on this week:

- Moving and refocusing tension elsewhere. Move tension in jaw to grounding in feet.
- Eyes looking out over ocean
- Let your eyes be wide and easy
- Shoulders wide and let your hands be loose
- Take up space. Think about the tips of my collarbones
- Double Breath – Two swift inhales and a long exhale to relieve tension
- How Wide my Upper Body Is

Here's a formal definition of "use" in AT Jargon:

Use - refers to the habitual and characteristic manner in which a person moves and uses their body, all the time, whatever they are doing. Our use is influenced by our thinking and by our emotions and to bring about changes in our use, we need to allow changes to take place in our thinking and in our reactions to things. [Use | Hilary King, MSTAT](https://www.hilaryking.net/glossary/use)

Here are links to the images of the shoulder girdle we looked at in class:
[3D Skeletal System: The Shoulder Girdle](https://www.visiblebody.com/blog/3d-skeletal-system-the-shoulder-girdle)
[Scapulothoracic joint: Muscles and nerves - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhuQOZzjh-A)

Alexander’s Directions for the shoulder girdle are: “Allow my shoulders to expand to the side, or allow my collar bones to expand and float, or widen to the upper arms…etc.”

Rather than working hard at “withholding consent”, when you find yourself tensing practice Mountain top or Ocean Vision or the Double Breath. Taking a moment to pause, and clear out the tension can be powerful. Maybe after doing that you can notice you were having a subtle stress thought (worry, overwhelm, rushing, frustration, irritation).

Your takeaways:

1. Leading with the head
2. Imagine a rocking chair to align top of spine
3. Aware of the length and sturdiness of my spine
4. When crawling, pull back with your tailbone to re-center.
5. Crawling (as a model for organizing movement).
6. Spinal Awareness, Strong spine
7. Withholding Consent
8. I withhold consent to engage my neck. My neck is Free!
9. Be more aware of my spine and be more aware of the tension in my neck.
10. I allow my neck to be free. Practice leading with my head.

See  [Text Neck - Physiopedia](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Text_Neck)

Tilting the head forward to 15 degrees places about 27 pounds of force on the neck [Text Neck - Physiopedia](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Text_Neck#cite_note-:0-1). This increases to 40 pounds at 30 degrees, 49 pounds at 45 degrees and 60 pounds at 60 degrees

HW:

1. Continue to practice the Constructive Rest Guided Audio that I sent last week. Aim for 3x.
2. Observe examples of the head/neck/back relationship in life. For examples of efficiency, look at animals and children under 5. For examples of inefficiency, look at everyone else. Occasionally adults have excellent use, but often they are elite athletes, not from an industrial culture, or they have been trained in the AT. What did you notice about your own patterns? Come to class prepared to talk about your observations.
3. Bonus, look at actors. Identify an actor with exceptional poise and look up their training. Did they get Alexander Technique at school?
