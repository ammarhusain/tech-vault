# Module 1 - Foundation
- Body
	 - When people listen to us they notice - 7% words, 38% tone of [[voice]] and inflection, 55% body language
	 - Next time you are presenting, pay attention to your body and maintain an awareness of it for as long as you speak. If you feel tension, then relax. If you feel fidgety, command it to stop. Excessive tension and unnecessary fidgeting restrict your natural, authentic expression.
- Breathing
	 - Adults get in the habit of using their chest muscles for breathing. Thats a problem because chest breathing is an evolutionary adaptation to emergency situations.
	 - Breathe into your back and stomach. This will give you a lot more oxygen
- Cliff
	 - “The Cliff” happens when you suddenly run out of things to say.
	 - Instead of panicking, look around, smile, and reset your breathing
- Triggers
	 - Triggers of anxiety or fear are another thing to look out for.
	 - Two main triggers: Auditory triggers and visual triggers
	 - Can be diffused by first acknowledging their presence and then disrupting their influence

My section notes

- Have a “preliminary” ritual - Eg: Fist bump chest
- Open body language
- Slow down and breathe

# Module 2 - Take the Stage

Energy and calibration

Good speakers “**take the stage**”. They don’t borrow it, they claim it. Engage the physical, emotional and verbal minds of your audiences.

Manage your energy in 3 important dimensions:

- Physical:
	 - Adequate sleep, rest & nutrition. Establish a [[tom all|daily]] routine for exercise, brief breaks every 90-120 mins
- Emotional:
	 - Engage in activities that nourish and stimulate positive emotions. Know and honor your values in life. Stop stressing over the little things. Replenish your physical energy.
- Mental:
	 - Needed to calculate, plan and articulate your thoughts on & off stage.
	 - Stop multitasking.

My section notes

- Be certain: People attack uncertainty
- Bring 5-10% higher energy that you think is normal
- Maintain composure if/when challenged
- Engage the audience by asking enrolling questions:
- Pause and let it sink in - repeat statements, commenting on statements
- Vocal modulation

# Module 3 - Connect
- One-on-one
	 - Shift from thinking of public speaking as “many on one” situation, to thinking of it as a series of one-on-one conversations strung together
	 - Speak to them one-on-one. Use sustained eye contact to connect until you get a reaction from them
- Step Forward
	 - To ensure that you connect to the audience you can physically step forward as a mean to temporarily exaggerate the connection.

Module 4 - Engage

- Be Interested
	 - Passionately speak about your product, service or project
	 - Make others interested by asking them Enrolling, Re-Enrolling and Follow-up questions throughout your presentation : “How many of you ...?”
		  - Re-enrolling question when you see audience might be getting bored.
		  - Can also ask a question direct to a person
		  - Follow up questions: “so far so good?”, “would you agree?”, “does this make sense?”
- Reference others - By giving credit to those involved in certain accomplishments you not only engage the audience but also promote camaraderie
- Pause - Allow the audience to digest what you shared with them, let it sink in
- Repeat statements
- You can emphasize important points in your presentation by commenting on them, thereby sustaining an idea in the audience’s conscious awareness for a longer period of time.
- Point away when talking about something negative
- How to move your body to keep your audience engages and to keep your own thoughts clear - use Anchoring
	 - Spatial
	 - Emotional
