### Planning Phase

[Roam Around - Your AI-Powered Travel Assistant | Visit a City Today](https://www.roamaround.io/)

1. Shibuya: Famous for its busy crossing, trendy fashion, and nightlife scene. It's a great location for young travelers who enjoy exploring the latest fashion trends and the newest cafes and restaurants.
2. Shinjuku: The city's entertainment district with many options for shopping, dining, and entertainment. It's a popular area for tourists, with many hotels and easy access to transportation.
3. Asakusa: A historic neighborhood known for its traditional atmosphere and famous Sensoji Temple. It's a great location for travelers who want to experience traditional Japan and learn about the country's rich cultural heritage.

Now, let's talk about must-see places and activities in Tokyo:

1. Visit the Tsukiji Fish Market: One of the world's largest fish markets and a must-visit for foodies. You can watch the tuna auction, enjoy fresh seafood at the many restaurants, and explore the surrounding area.
2. Explore the Meiji Shrine: A serene oasis in the middle of the city, the Meiji Shrine is a popular spot for locals and tourists alike. Take a stroll through the forested park to the main shrine building, and learn about Japan's Shinto religion.
3. Take in the view from the Tokyo Skytree: The tallest tower in Japan, the Tokyo Skytree offers incredible views of the city from its observation deck.
4. Enjoy the cherry blossoms: If you're visiting in May, you'll likely catch the tail end of the cherry blossom season. Head to Ueno Park or Shinjuku Gyoen to see the beautiful pink flowers in bloom.
5. Try traditional Japanese food: From sushi to ramen to tempura, Tokyo is a food lover's paradise. Don't be afraid to try new things and explore the city's diverse culinary scene.
6. Visit Harajuku: A colorful and vibrant neighborhood known for its fashion, cosplay, and street food. It's a great spot for people-watching and exploring the many quirky shops and cafes.
7. Take a day trip to Mount Fuji: If you have time, consider taking a day trip to see Japan's most iconic mountain. You can hike or take a scenic train ride to enjoy the stunning views.
Sensoji Temple, Asakusa has several other attractions worth visiting, such as:

- The Tokyo Skytree, a 634-meter tower with an observation deck that offers panoramic views of the city.
- The Sumida River, which is a great spot for a relaxing boat ride or a stroll along the riverbank.
- The Asakusa Culture Tourist Information Center, a modern building with a rooftop observation deck that offers fantastic views of Sensoji Temple and the surrounding area.
- The Asahi Beer Tower, a unique building shaped like a beer glass that's home to a beer hall and restaurant.

From travel hacks
If you want to hack your daily food “allowance”, do two lunches. Do the first at 10:45 am, then another at 2:45 pm. You’ll get to try more places and, bonus, avoid some lines. But I will say this; you won’t be able to avoid lines forever. Waiting in line is just a part of the dining process, so it’s better to know this going into it.

Walk a triangle from [Omotesando](https://en.japantravel.com/tokyo/omotesando#:~:text=13%201%20Free-,About%20Omotesando,Harajuku%20area%20including%20Takeshita%20Street.) to [Harajuku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harajuku) and then down to [Shibuya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya). You can easily do this all on the same day and experience some great highlights of Tokyo.

Going to a high-end hotel is the best way to enjoy a city view in a relaxed atmosphere instead of in tourist-filled spots. The New [Four Seasons at Otemachi](https://www.fourseasons.com/otemachi/) has the best view of the Imperial Garden. Right behind it, you can see Mount Fuji on a very clear day (in the winter).

- In Omotesando, you’ll experience small boutique shops and luxury “rodeo drive” style shopping.
- In Harajuku, you’ll experience a unique clash of styles (think hip-hop meets little bo-peep). 
- As you keep going, you’ll find the [Meiji Shrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Shrine), which then turns into [Shibuya Crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya_Crossing), the busiest pedestrian crossing in the world.
- Use the [Yamanote Line](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1lu3soobujkRtWeTDs2zniDHS3ts&hl=en_US&ll=35.67871194924068%2C139.7395425&z=10). It’s a great option since the rail travels in a circle around the city. Also, if you try to take in the map of every single line, you’ll experience a sensory overload.
- The Yamanote line is a perfect way to visualize Tokyo geographically because the city is structured like a clock:
	 - 1:00 - 2:00 are the older areas
	 - 3:00 is also a central hub of activity
	 - 6:00 - 9:00 are the newer neighborhoods (and Brandon’s favorites_)_
	 - 9:00 - 10:00 are the major stations
