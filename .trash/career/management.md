# OKR

[Designing OKRs for impact - Goal Setting: Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/goal-setting-objectives-and-key-results-okrs/designing-okrs-for-impact?u=56685617)

- An objective is always followed by, as measured by, and three to five key results intended to measure progress. 
- While the objective is the where you want to go, the key results are the how you'll know if you got there. 
- Key results are the quantitative targets used to measure the success of the objective: quantitative, specific, time-bound, and measurable.
- They're always time-bound and specific and include a number.
- Objectives inspire and are qualitative statements.
- JFK asked the janitor what he did at NASA. He replied, "I'm here to put a man on the moon." This man understood what his company's top objective was and he was inspired by it. The foundation of an OKR is the objective, the O.
	  - Identify all the problems your company has and build an objective to solve them
  - A good set of KRs answer the following questions: Have we achieved what we set out to do? And how will we know if we've met our objective?
  - What gets measured gets managed. Good KRs are outcomes and not tasks. If it doesn't have a number, its not a KR
  - 3-5 KRs per objective
  - Leadership choses the objective. Employees decide the key results
  - Magic happens when different people from the group start to get onboard with an objective, while others challenge. Alignment is their ultimate goal. A great strategy to use is asking, "So what?" For example, if someone says, "We want more customers," you can ask, "So what?" They may say, "So we become more profitable." "So what?" This helps you and your team find a clear shared understanding of the company goals.
  - Managing OKRs
	  - Set cadence
	  - Establish single source of truth
	  - Set predetermined milestones
	  - Trust your leaders
