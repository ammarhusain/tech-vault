Interest Tracing?
Prepayment penalty and bubble payment should be zero? No prepayment penalty, can refinance anytime

Got [[Pre-approval letter.pdf]] today
Relationship discount $50k rest $150k in stocks
If I do 20% then 200k can all be stock... 20% is better rate -> 0.25%
500k -> 3/8%
What about 7 yr ARM? 10 year is currently on promotion & best product atm.
Easy to update letter with higher loan amount & down payment % if needed
Doesn't know anything about interest tracing

Only offer a minimum of 20% down
Primarily relationship based firm. Move banking, deposit, set auto pay.
Keep at least $25k in checking. If more then that could provide further discounts.
30 year 5.4%
10year ARM 5.05%, 7 year ARM 4.65%
Closing cost & time: provide credit towards closing 2500k (covers all closing cost)
Budget for 1% of purchase in addition to downpayment
Title services + title insurance + 1 year home insurance premium interest up front + some interest up front ~$10k
If you keep 10% of loan amount brings down 0.3%
First 18 months of holding cash for relationship
They underwrite request up front: takes 3-4 days. Credit inquiry is only good for 90 days
Hard to calculate APR for ARM loan. APR is simply interest rates + closing costs.

[[2022-09-29-Thursday]] Chat with Sherry Wang (Citibank) **
Have relationship transfer program.
Transfer $50k get 0.125% off the rate, next tier for $250k get 0.25%, $500k 0.375%
JUMBO loan DTI is 43%
5/6 or 7/6 ARM is not better than 10/6 : 4.75-4.875% if I move $200k
30 year fixed - 5.25%
Minimum 15% down, no PMI needed and no escrow account needed ... rate would be 0.125% different maybe but could possibly match. $50k has to be cash in a Citi checking account just to close the loan. Can be used right after the loan closes.
Cannot do less than <15%
Usually 25-30 day close.
Closing cost: appraisal + lender fee = $2k
No discount for Google employees
No one can compete with a 15% down situation
She also does the pre underwriting if needed

[[2022-07-13-Wednesday]] Chat with Gigi

- 1% rebate … does not issue 1099
- Credit unions are better at closing
- Big banks usually have better rates with relationship discount - better for straightforward cases … low DTI, simple properties - BofA, Wells Fargo etc

[[2022-07-11-Monday]] - chat with Justin Brilman

- 2 decades of experience. Wells Fargo tends to be slow. He is a guaranteed close
- More offers are getting accepted now. Sellers now are looking more towards the buyers ability to perform
- Fully qualified underwritten - 2 weeks to close (same week that you apply)
- 5 year ARM with adjustment every 5 years - 4.375%
- condos are usually a bit worse when it comes to pricing
- if you cross over 50% non owner occupied then lenders don’t like that. so terms are worse
- JUMBO loans - about 25% of lenders have doubts on risk.
- Avg 2020 & 2021 RSU grants — mostly get factored in for DTI (also counts in reserves)
- credit score & downpayment - biggest factor for interest rates.
- non-depository mortgage lenders - correspondent lender (guaranteed rate) or mortgage broker (like Lucero)
- Guaranteed rate - underwrite & close the loan then pass it over - so appraisal, funding etc
- He does both. Fiduciary duty to the buyer. No compensation derived from the lender or the product.
- Closing costs: $1440 ($1300-$1500 to do the loan) … About 1% of purchase price (high estimate) $10-13k.
	 - Lender, title company (~6k), pro rated interest, first month of interest, pro rated property tax
	 - Realtors end up picking the title company
- Interest rates may not be the biggest factor. Transactions close are important. Accessibility
- Service + commodity business… Credit unions (redwood credit unions) are popping

[[2022-06-29-Wednesday]] - chat with Lucero Perez - Flagstar Bank
Sana will need to sign a deed waiving rights. Makes sense to have just me on the loan since she does not have credit and that will be problematic.
10/6mo ARM - 4.5% - $6080.22 (mortgage + interest) + $1478.13 (property tax) + $150 (homeowners insurance) ~ $7700
5/6mo ARM - 4.25%
5, 7 & 10 year are the common ARM products.
You could refinance after 6 payments made.
Property tax 1.1825% rate for SF
30yr fixed - 5.125%
15yr fixed - 5.125%
5% more down rates go down by an 1/8th
Costs for the bank
  Underwriting fee $995 + $695, appraisal $1600

  $7100 - 3390 escrow fee + title insurance for lender & owner
Broker from multiple banks - options for multiple products
Know how to deal with RSUs
Flagstar is a reputed underwriter (offers get accepted sooner)

[How To Buy A House (STEP BY STEP) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBP2E8J6SZ0)
DTI (Debt to Income ratio) should be less than 36%
Dont spend more than 28% of your net income on your PITI (Principal, Interest, Tax, Insurance, HOA fees, utilities etc)
Avoid PMI (mortgage insurance) so put down 20%
Closing costs - this is what you pay the bank for appraisal, fees etc. Can be anywhere between 1-6% of the value of the home. Have at least 3% ready for closing
Look at price per square foot
Earnest money — its a good faith deposit
Inspection - usually done by the seller in SF
Appraisal - gives the value of the house
Final walk through - make sure seller shows you everything
Close

[Home Mortgages 101 (For First Time Home Buyers) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU69g6Ao47A)
4 factors in mortgages PITI
Principal - house value - downpayment
Interest - Rate of borrowing money (better credit score means lower rate)
Taxes - property taxes. These are usually held in escrow that means the bank will pay it for you twice a year
Insurance - just like car insurance
Types of mortgages:

- Fixed rate - most popular is 30 year. Interest rate never changes
- ARM - adjusted rate… fixed for a certain period like 5/1 or 5/5 means fixed for the first 5 years and then adjusts based on LIBOR market rate every 1 or 5 years.
	 - Benefits people who dont want to hold on to a mortgage for very long or believe interest rates are going to be going down.
- FHA loan - insured by federal housing. allows you to put down 3.5%. typically for people with lower credit score
- VA - insured by Veterans Affairs admin. 0% down
- USDA - backed by dept of agriculture. usually for rural areas
For people with more wealth there is also:
- JUMBO loan - just means a higher loan amount so you have to put down 20% but rates can be lower
- Interest only mortgage

[15 YEAR VS 30 YEAR MORTGAGE - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkclyj0V2T0&list=RDCMUCL_v4tC26PvOFytV1_eEVSg&index=5)
15 year loans usually have lower rates… 0.25% - 1% lower
Usually you end up paying less interest overall
Con is higher payment every month
30 yr mortgages gives you extra funds for investing. If stock market is going up 7% while you are paying 4% interest you are still better off.

### Deducting Mortgage Interest on $1m+ Homes

The IRS allows you deduct home mortgage interest on the first $750,000 of a mortgage ($375,000 if not married, filing jointly)¹ which is an amazing benefit for homeowners. However in places like San Francisco or New York, it’s almost impossible to find a home where your mortgage isn’t going to exceed that limit, so you’re not able to deduct all the mortgage interest you pay. Well if you fall into that scenario, there’s a tax hack that when executed correctly, will greatly increase the amount of interest you can deduct (note: this is NOT tax advice). Also, I know this won’t be relevant for everyone, but it’s such a great hack for some of you that I wanted to share.

So how it works is that the interest on any money you borrow and then use to invest can be categorized as investment interest expense and deducted from investment gains (e.g., interest, dividends, cap gains) and thus reducing the [[taxes]] you’d owe. Two practical ways this could work:

1. If you already have a mortgage over $750,000, you would use your cash to pay that mortgage down to $750,000 and then later do a cash-out refinance to bring the balance of the mortgage back up to however much you want. Then use all the money you cash out to invest.
2. You want to buy a home and can pay for it in cash. Then within 90 days you do a Cash Recoup Mortgage and use all but $750,000 of the cash you get back from the mortgage to invest.

I don’t expect most people to have this much cash just sitting around, but if you recently had a windfall that you’re planning to invest, this could make sense before you make the investment. Or the tax savings could be enough for it to make sense to sell your investments to execute this strategy and then reinvest the money after.

If any of this is interesting, I’d recommend reading this [great blog post](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkN2OhCAMhZ9muNMggo4XXOzNvoZB6Ci7_Bgo47hPvziTNG3apjmnn1YIa0yn3GNGcqUZzx1kgCM7QIRESoY0WyOZ6NkwioEYyU13F3di8_xIAF5ZJzEVIHtZnNUKbQzXRS_EvRdkk9qIxUA_cKpGqjUFTTvVATViEBMF8RFWxVgIGiQ8IZ0xAHFyQ9zzrf-6se8ax3G0-bm0OvraLS6uuVav0tlgjB7Od_ey3v7ZsDYGTNFoFweNDfUVyNjAa4eQgVjJKGO072hXXfKuZa2ZYBBKcaX58KjOWl0eh1jtz41Tv7I2lyWj0r-XPEnSJ7WVrGyo6_Vi8J5XBHOtvgSL5wxBVXXzoYMfyG9e8woBUoVvZoWyG_gwsXFiE-v5B0bFJygVfGQ9qcIm1qsglXO4wVZN5H9995eW) from SVB and **ABSOLUTELY** talking to an accountant beforehand. Also, part of the complexity here is around a concept called “interest tracing” which requires you *trace* the funds to show that they were used for the correct purpose. If you’re interested in learning more about it, Deloitte has a great *[Interest Tracing Guide](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJw1UU3O3CAMPc2wS0QIZCYLFpWqnqD7yANOQptABKb55vZ1ZloJGf_7-dkB4ZLyyx6pkLjERK8DbcSzbEiEWdSCeQreKtOr4W4G4a323cM8RCjTnBF3CJulXFEc9bkFBxRSvCp6Yx69EasFNd8R5qvIS6fNQysE0PM8duNTzvIzGKoPGB1a_IP5lSKKza5ER7n1327qB7_zPFXrcUuBkbUu7exzKRJGYs3DZX__F2a1lstOru6ccOk_4evtbgi-mv99GiWVbAJ3yViooQwuxKVZavDYHn4WwXKGkn0nO15Idy1jGHEwvAE4PcxmMK2r82mW8Oum5b6ottRnIXC_L4wi2z3DWguEyOHlouvtZ7Ym_vcaA70mjPDc0H-IpM893tROC0bMfCc_Adlu0MOo7qMaVa8_vDHTRkqj76oXPNgnrooWto1WXBlE-Qv-_6Tm)*.
