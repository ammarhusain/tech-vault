## Highlights
- Identifying promising research directions. Things like [character](https://www.anthropic.com/research/claude-character) and [computer use](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use) started off as a fraction of one person’s time, taking a bet that some technique applied to some problem was going to work really well, and ended up being a major influence on Anthropic’s research direction.

- I think of finding high-leverage work as having two interrelated components:
  • **Agency:** i.e. some combination of the initiative/proactiveness to try to make things happen, and [relentlessness and resourcefulness](https://paulgraham.com/relres.html) to make sure you’ll succeed.
  • **Taste:** you need a good intuition for what things will and won’t work well to try. Taste is important both “in the large” (picking important problems) and “in the small” (picking approaches to solving those problems that will work well); I usually see people first become great at the latter, then the former.

- Of course, the same “high leverage projects are non-obvious” phenomenon also means that some of your self-driven high-impact project attempts will probably fail, because you misjudged their impact or difficulty. Because of this, you should think of them as *bets that might or might not pay off*, and—at least until you’ve proven your ability to make good bets over fairly long time horizons—it’s best to keep these as part of a portfolio with low-risk projects as well, to avoid the situation where you bite off a single high-risk project, it doesn’t pan out, and people lose trust in your ability to pick your own projects.

- Whenever you’re debating what to do, explicitly ask yourself “what do I predict will happen if I choose option A?” and try to unroll the trajectory. Even if you think you’re already intuitively predicting the results of your choices, I’ve found it helps surprisingly much to be explicit—one of my manager role models asks me this (“what do you think will happen?”) every time I ask him for advice and it’s kind of silly how often it helps me realize something new.
