## Highlights
- [Ostrich Effect](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/loaded/201904/the-ostrich-effect):
  We often try to avoid info that we fear will cause us stress. Thus bills and work emails remain unopened, bank balances remain unchecked. This is counterproductive because ignoring a problem doesn't eliminate the problem or your anxiety; it only prolongs them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxgfjnr35s0z5eqezhyhcvs))
- [Epistemic Humility](https://behavioralscientist.org/epistemic-humility-coronavirus-knowing-your-limits-in-a-pandemic/#:~:text=Epistemic%20humility%20is%20an%20intellectual,the%20other%20characters%20don't.):
  Instead of trying to be right, try to be less wrong. Avoiding idiocy is easier than achieving genius, and by beginning from the position that you don't know enough (which you don't), you'll gain more awareness of your blindspots and become harder to fool. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxgkzr6vb5m0ek93fxcqjdj))
- [Mimetic Desire](https://mimetictheory.com/articles/mimetic-desire/#:~:text=Mimetic%20desire%20is%20desire%20according,into%20the%20structure%20of%20desire.):
  Craving is contagious; watching other people want a thing makes us want it too. It's why ads are so effective. But it puts us all into unnecessary competition as we fool ourselves into chasing what others are chasing simply because they are chasing it.

- [Overblown Implications Effect](https://xlab.berkeley.edu/connect/MGC_OIE.pdf)
  “We think people judge us by a single success or failure, but they don’t. If you mess up one meal no one thinks you're a bad chef, and if you have one great idea no one thinks you're a genius. People just aren't thinking about you that much.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxgpn59z52x5m1vsa6q2hbc))
- [Peter Principle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peter-principle.asp):
  People in a hierarchy such as a business or government will be promoted until they suck at their jobs, at which point they will remain where they are. As a result, the world is filled with people who suck at their jobs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxgrhphxcmstapp7ttc123n))
- [Gambler's Fallacy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamblersfallacy.asp#:~:text=What%20Is%20the%20Gambler's%20Fallacy,event%20or%20series%20of%20events.):
  We often feel we're owed luck for being unlucky. "The coin was heads 10 flips in a row, the next flip has gotta be tails!" But probability has no memory; it won't make amends for its past behavior. Therefore, treat every possibility independent of the past. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxgt1embah4dkv77wyv4fvk))
- [Shibboleth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth):
  An absurd ideological belief is a form of tribal signaling. It signifies that one considers their ideology more important than truth, reason, or sanity. To one's allies, this is an oath of unwavering loyalty. To one's enemies, it is a threat display. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxgyjm3e6qbgay2pacy9dcq))
- Law of Triviality ... Projects that require the least attention tend to get the most.
- [Brandolini's Law](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/01/28/bullshit-asymmetry-principle/) (aka the Bullshit Asymmetry Principle):
  It takes a lot more energy to refute bullshit than to produce it. Hence, the world is full of unrefuted bullshit. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxh8pewkv5r6asx5p3eh9gx))
- [Promethean Gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promethean_gap):
  Technology is outpacing wisdom; we're changing the world faster than we can adapt to it. Lagging ever more behind accelerating progress, we're increasingly unable to foresee the effects of what we create. We're amassing the power of gods, yet we remain apes.
