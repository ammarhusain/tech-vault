Full Title: Practical Deep Learning for Coders
Category: #readwise/articles

Date Highlighted: [[2023-04-14-Friday]]

## Highlights
- it’s a great learning goal because nearly every key technique in modern deep learning comes together in these methods. Contrastive learning, transformer models, auto-encoders, CLIP embeddings, latent variables, u-nets, resnets, and much more are involved in creating a single image. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0a3fxt73ksw6xckzztepn3))
- In this course, we’ll explore diffusion methods such as Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM). We’ll get our hands dirty implementing unconditional and conditional diffusion models, experimenting with different samplers, and diving into recent tricks like textual inversion and Dreambooth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0a3y0asbz0b787sfy2pc98))
- In this course, containing over 30 hours of video content, we implement the astounding [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) algorithm from scratch! That’s the [killer app](https://www.pcworld.com/article/916785/creating-ai-art-local-pc-stable-diffusion.html) that made the [internet freak out](https://devops.com/stable-diffusion-public-richixbw/), and caused the media to say “[you may never believe what you see online again](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-stable-diffusion-you-may-never-believe-what-you-see-online-again/)”.
