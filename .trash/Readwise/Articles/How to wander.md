## Highlights
- In most of us there survives an opposing curiosity, a desire to see what’s around the corner. It doesn’t require an epic, round-the-world journey. We merely need go where nobody says we have to go, for no particular reason, where the smells and tastes and the breeze on our faces awaken us from the soporific haze of habit. To practise an enlivening sort of indolence. To drift, to roam, to colour outside the lines a bit. To wander. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gywqegv1xj9trswm0hcz4qn5))
- ‘[W]e have the tendency to run into the future in order to look for happiness,’ [wrote](https://www.parallax.org/product/how-to-walk/) the Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh. ‘Running has become a habit … Many of us have been running all our lives.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gywqpg7kbh1hvd0yn0zvknvb))
## New highlights: [[2024-04-25-Thursday]] at 2:50 AM
- Rushing toward some goal in the future is fuelled by the *idea* of how good you’ll feel when you get there. But anticipated pleasure is just a thought, not a place for your body to feel fully alive. Focus on the physical sensations of where you are right now, which is at once the method and the reward for wandering.
  Whether you wander in a city or in nature, engaging your senses is like [wine tasting](https://psyche.co/guides/how-do-you-select-a-bottle-of-wine-that-youll-enjoy): just as a wine expert distinguishes and articulates flavours, colours, textures and so on, you can sharpen your palette and learn to recognise forms, scents, sounds and sensations, and the names for them in nature and civilisation.
