## Highlights
- The six horizons:
  Ground: Calendar actions - The ground floor. There is a large volume of next actions, e-mails, and calendar invites for you to organize. Try using the
  [GTD template](https://coda.io/t/GTD-by-David-Allen_tSkr0tKKfCB)
  ⁠
  to help organize these items.
  Horizon 1: Projects - Anything that takes more than one next action to complete. Most people have between 30 and 100 projects.
  Horizon 2: Area of focus and accountability - At this horizon you define what your job is. New projects can be created and old projects are eliminated at this level.
  Horizon 3: One to two-year goals and objectives - What will your job look like in 12-18 months?
  Horizon 4: Three to five-year vision - At this level, the goals and directions of your larger team or company influence how you get your job done.
  Horizon 5: Purpose and principles - The ultimate “big picture” question to be answered. What is your purpose? What is the job and lifestyle you want? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvgab7qsf4pgre6dh5sfmp7r))
    - Note: 1 - Todoist or Motion
      2 - A note in the Projects folder of Obsidian
      3 - notes in Areas folder of obsidian
      4 - New note in Areas that list the next 1-2 year goals?
      5 - A new vision note that lists some of these longish term goals?
      6 - doctrine note in Obsidian
      I think I am missing some good delineation is levels 3,4 & 5. They all seemed to have mushed up together
