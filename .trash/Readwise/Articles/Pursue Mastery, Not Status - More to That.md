## Highlights
- Status is obtained by collecting attention, whereas mastery is achieved by refining intuition. Status is always relational, so external validation is a prerequisite to feeling secure. Mastery, on the other hand, is gauged by your unique sense of progress, which can only be derived from within.
- The paradox of mastery is that even if you could care less about status, people will find their way to you since mastery is a gravitating force, which will give you status in turn.The key here is to continue seeing status for the societal poison that it is, and to resist its allure.
