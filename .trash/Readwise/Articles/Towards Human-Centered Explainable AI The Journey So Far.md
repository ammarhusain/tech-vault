## Highlights
- To achieve our goal, we pioneered the notion of Rationale Generation is a process of producing a natural language explanation for agent behavior as if a human had performed the behavior. Conceived as a form of post-hoc interpretability, the technical contribution comes from looking at explanation generation in natural language as a translation task using neural machine translation (NMT). We used a deep neural network trained on human explanations to generate rationales to justify the decisions of an AI agent.
- We can think of this phase as an existence proof—can we do this? Short answer – yes. How do we know? We mainly used procedural evaluation (BLUE score) to establish the accuracy of the generated rationales.
    - Note: I guess this is just telling you whether the explanations produced are coherent english. Not really whether they are good explanations or not.
