## Highlights
- A lot of the focus on AI use, especially in the corporate world, has been stuck in what I call the “automation mindset” - viewing AI primarily as a tool for speeding up existing workflows like email management and meeting transcription. This perspective made sense for earlier AI models, but it's like evaluating a smartphone solely on its ability to make phone calls. The Gen3 generation give the opportunity for a fundamental rethinking of what's possible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnkjg3fgdvx9xyy81rfnyxqp))
- the focus needs to move from task automation to capability augmentation. Instead of asking "what tasks can we automate?" leaders should ask "what new capabilities can we unlock?" And they will need to build the capacity in their own organizations to help explore, and develop these changes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jnkjkm3f60dkk7e3rckrgqnh))
