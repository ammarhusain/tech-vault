## Highlights
- OpenSea provides a one-stop shop to discover, buy, and sell any non-fungible digital asset that conforms to a popular standard like ERC721, and it also quickly tells you the “who, what, when, where” about a particular NFT. OpenSea shows you the provenance, trading, and sales history of digital items in a readable, trusted way.
- Consider how Zillow transformed the experience of discovering and comparing homes for sale. Property ownership records exist and you could in theory go physically search them at the county recorder’s office, but it’d be complex and time consuming. Just like Zillow takes raw real estate data and makes it usable in a trusted and reliable way at your fingertips, OpenSea makes NFTs searchable, usable, and organized.
