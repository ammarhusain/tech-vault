## Highlights
- We identified three common reputational fears that hold
  people back from seeing themselves as leaders:
  Fear of seeming domineering
  Many of the participants in our study expressed concern about being seen as bossy, autocratic, or domineering if they were to take on a leadership role.
  Fear of seeming different
  Fear of seeming unqualified
  Regardless of whether they actually saw themselves as qualified, many of our participants said that they were afraid that others would view them as unfit for leadership.
- No one likes to think of themselves as driven by fear, and
  leadership can often come with substantial challenges. So, when
  pursuing leadership feels risky, people subconsciously redefine their
  own identities to justify avoiding it. It’s a lot more comfortable to
  rationalize an unwillingness to lead by telling yourself that you’re “just
  not a leader” than to admit that you’re afraid of what others might
  think. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmdp666zhstpfectdfe8pdzj))
- people who view leadership as a learnable skill may feel more
  comfortable with setbacks, whereas those with a fixed view may assume
  that any mistakes they make as leaders permanently damage their
  reputation and indicate that they simply aren’t meant to lead. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmdpevewmde9yqd4134qyska))
- Parker Palmer compellingly writes,
  “Leadership is a concept we often resist. It seems immodest, even self-
  aggrandizing, to think of ourselves as leaders. But if it is true that we
  are made for community, then leadership is everyone’s vocation, and it
  can be an evasion to insist that it is not. When we live in the close-knit
  ecosystem called community, everyone follows and everyone leads.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmdpdqwyb6gqzp09mh0s9q75))
