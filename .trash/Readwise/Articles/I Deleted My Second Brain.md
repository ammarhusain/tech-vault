## Highlights
- PKM systems promise coherence, but they often deliver a kind of abstracted confusion. The more I wrote into my vault, the less I felt. A quote would spark an insight, I’d clip it, tag it, link it - and move on. But the insight was never lived. It was stored. Like food vacuum-sealed and never eaten, while any nutritional value slips away. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzthsakcs5t6bkf44awjgz2y))
- In trying to remember everything, I outsourced the act of reflection. I didn’t revisit ideas. I didn’t interrogate them. I filed them away and trusted the structure. But a structure is not thinking. A tag is not an insight. And an idea not re-encountered might as well have never been had.

- When I first started using PKM tools, I believed I was solving a problem of forgetting. Later, I believed I was solving a problem of integration. Eventually, I realized I had created a new problem: deferral. The more my system grew, the more I deferred the work of thought to some future self who would sort, tag, distill, and extract the gold.

- This mirrors a deeper psychological error. The belief that by naming a goal, you are closer to achieving it. That by storing a thought, you have understood it. That by filing a fact, you have earned the right to deploy it.
  This is productivity as performance. It is a symptom of modern intellectual insecurity: the fear of losing track, of forgetting, of not being caught up. But caught up to what? The feed? The discourse? The meme cycle?
  There is no finish line in the pursuit of knowing. Only presence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jztj2cp8jnm99dq3y5bgkk9a))
