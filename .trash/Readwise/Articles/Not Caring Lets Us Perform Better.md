## Highlights
- • Self 1: the explicit, thinking part that tries to catch the ball
  • Self 2: the implicit, non-thinking part that actually catches the ball
  The more Self 1 cares about achieving a goal, the more it *interferes* with the natural functioning of Self 2. This is why, counterintuitively, the less you care about something, the more easily, effortlessly and effectively it can be achieved. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp914v8xj8xd9h8dg7ptg6xe))
- Caring ... comes with a sense of the outcome being important, that it (or we) would *bad* if the outcome weren’t achieved. There is a physical tension associated with it.
  Intending is the activation energy required to take a specific action. I can intend to catch the ball (or not) as it flies towards me, while not caring whether or not I actually catch it.
- the ideal combination to minimise or remove self-interference is to have a strong and unambiguous intention while caring as little as possible. The worst combination for our performance is to have a weak and ambiguous intention while caring strongly about achieving a particular outcome. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp91dvjsvkg8hetvj862vg02))
- Even in competition, it’s possible to maintain a position of “I want to win, but I don’t mind if I don’t”. That mental posture often brings about a sense of ease and lightness that unlock greater levels of performance that actually make winning more likely.
