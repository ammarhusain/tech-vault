## Highlights
- Reserve peak times for activities that are analytical, strategic, or require deep focus.
- Adopt the habit of tackling your biggest thing the moment you sit down to "work," before touching anything small, and you will see a huge difference in how much you get done in a day.
- Don’t bother your brain with notifications for every single new email — check email proactively, instead.
- To grab attendees’ attention and encourage punctual arrivals, consider starting your meetings with a humorous YouTube video or a piece of engaging content.
- For every 15 minutes that your meeting lasts, aim for attendees to end the meeting with at least one takeaway. Ending the meeting with a brief recap of the most important items covered is also a good way to make sure everyone walks away with clear outcomes in mind.
- Your productivity comes down to two things, your ability to open loops and your ability to close them. You need time for both, but most people spend all their time closing loops.
