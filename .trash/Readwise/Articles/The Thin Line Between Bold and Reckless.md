## Highlights
- The line between “inspiringly bold” and “foolishly reckless” can be a millimeter thick and only visible with hindsight. But it’s easy to view the process that led to successful outcomes as something to emulate, and the process that led to failures as something to avoid. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfeekg04j1k9e9v0dxp59zrg))
- Case studies can be dangerous because we study extreme examples, and extreme examples are often the least applicable to other situations, given their complexity. You’ll get closer to something actionable by looking for broad patterns of things like how people respond to surprises, how fragile competitive advantages can be, how quickly people/businesses/economies evolve, and what makes people happy.

    - Note: this is a good point and something that I need to get better at. its foolish to look at specific successful people and how they behave, their age, their actions etc to emulate. look at broader patterns - dont try to replicate that specific case study and give up if it doesn't follow the script
      .act
- The only thing more dangerous than underestimating how risky someone else’s strategy was is not realizing that the entire strategy only worked in a different era. When you accept that things change over time you become less interested in specific strategies used in the past and more interested in broad topics, like how people discovered the strategies to begin with.
