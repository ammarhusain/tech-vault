## Highlights
- These larger models have shown [emergent capabilities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07682.pdf) of complex reasoning, reasoning with knowledge, and out-of-distribution robustness, none of which are present in smaller, more specialized models. These big ones are called **foundation models** because developers can build applications on top of them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grh78b61fq2g91sam12thyt2))
- Builders face an unappealing choice: easy to build but hard to defend — or the opposite. In the first option, foundation models allow developers to create apps in a weekend — or in minutes — which used to take months. But the developers are limited to those proprietary models’ off-the-shelf capabilities, which other developers can also use, meaning the developers must be creative to find a source of differentiation. In the second option, developers can extend the capabilities of open-source model architectures to build something novel and defensible. But that requires a galactic level of technical depth, which too few teams possess. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grh7b35yn9vdtccatdm2a791))

  Looking at the state of the foundation model stack today, we see three opportunities ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grh7gn5s54cwfv2g9csq89g5))
- Frameworks for foundation models will make it easy to combine things like context across multiple calls, prompt engineering, and choice of foundation model (or multiple models in sequence). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grh9e4ykdcce9wd3afx4kg1h))
- [LangChain](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Dust.tt](https://dust.tt), [Fixie.ai](https://fixie.ai/), [GPT Index](https://github.com/jerryjliu/gpt_index), and [Cognosis](https://github.com/cognosisai/platform) are the projects catching developers’ attention in this part of the stack ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grh9epckk2d1chznezgqd9ex))
- Today, foundation models are limited to reasoning about the facts on which they were trained. But that’s super constraining for application developers and end users that need to make decisions based on data that changes extremely fast. Think about the weather, financial markets, travel, supply inventory, etc. So, it will be a big deal when we figure out “hot” information retrieval, where instead of training or editing the model, we instead let the model call out to external data sources and reason about those in real time.
