## Highlights
- We pre-train our model on selected public GitHub code and fine-tune it on our relatively small competitive programming dataset. At evaluation time, we create a massive amount of C++ and Python programs for each problem, orders of magnitude larger than previous work. Then we filter, cluster, and rerank those solutions to a small set of 10 candidate programs that we submit for external assessment. This automated system replaces competitorsâ€™ trial-and-error process of debugging, compiling, passing tests, and eventually submitting.
- AlphaCode ranked within the top 54% in real-world programming competitions, an advancement that demonstrates the potential of deep learning models for tasks that require critical thinking. These models elegantly leverage modern machine learning to express solutions to problems as code, circling back to the symbolic reasoning root of AI from decades ago.
