## Highlights
- With RGB-Stacking, our goal is to train a robotic arm via reinforcement learning to stack objects of different shapes. We place a parallel gripper attached to a robot arm above a basket, and three objects in the basket — one red, one green, and one blue, hence the name RGB. The task is simple: stack the red object on top of the blue object within 20 seconds, while the green object serves as an obstacle and distraction. The learning process ensures that the agent acquires generalised skills through training on multiple object sets. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq3ep5dtbftb4dyj3j9kdjmr))
- In “Skill Mastery,” our goal is to train a single agent that’s skilled in stacking a predefined set of five triplets. In “Skill Generalisation,” we use the same triplets for evaluation, but train the agent on a large set of training objects — totalling more than a million possible triplets. To test for generalisation, these training objects exclude the family of objects from which the test triplets were chosen ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq3er485sr2actzrtnhnh6rk))
