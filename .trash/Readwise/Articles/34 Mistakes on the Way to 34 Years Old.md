## Highlights
- If I had to go back and give a younger version of myself one word of advice it would be: “Relax.” It’s almost preposterous how intensely, passionately, anxiously I was worked up about certain things—how seriously I took things that, in retrospect, matter so little that I don’t even remember them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmdpp4cjwjw689sxnysmtnce))
- Stuff is better when you don’t rush. If you think you have to rush, you’re either whipping yourself for no reason, or pursuing something too ephemeral to begin with. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmdpqny3m6sf27vhgm3vttvj))
- Most of my regrets—things I wish I’d done, things I wish I’d said, stands I wish I’d taken—have one thing in common: [Fear](https://ryanholiday.net/the-important-thing-is-to-not-be-afraid/). We worry about *what will happen if…* But Marcus Aurelius has the answer: “You’ll meet tomorrow with the same weapons you have now.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmdpxmvj2emxq6spec70frs4))
- Of all the people (or types of people) I’ve had strong negative opinions or judgements about from afar, only few turned out to be even close to as obnoxious or stupid or awful as I thought. In fact, more often than not, I ended up liking them quite a bit. The world works better when we get to know each other. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmdq1w3c2nj07ztdywxep57d))
- You know deep down that accomplishing things won’t make you happy, but I think I always fantasized that it would at least feel *really good.* [I was so wrong](https://ryanholiday.net/how-does-it-feel-to-get-everything-you-ever-wanted/). Hitting #1 for the first time as an author felt like…nothing. Being a “millionaire”…nothing. [It’s a trick of evolution that drives us, and no one is immune from making this mistake](https://forge.medium.com/the-life-changing-magic-of-having-enough-38d78a5f6963). The mistake to really avoid though is the one that comes after the anti-climatic accomplishment, the one where you go: “Ah, it’s that I need to *repeat* this success, it’s that I didn’t get *enough*. More will do it.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmdq3wep31kqp9v5a9rgh94s))
- It’s good to be frugal, but if you don’t spend your money to make your life or your relationships or your work easier, what exactly are you going to spend it on? Actually, what I’ve found is that it is *very* expensive to be cheap. You just pay for it in the form of a frustrated spouse or a stressful life or with shit that never works and you have to end up replacing a bunch of times anyway. ... You are expending energy in the wrong places.
- There’s a great Kurt Vonnegut story about marriage. He realized, fighting one day with his wife, that what they were really both saying was, “*You’re not enough people.*” You can only expect so much from a person. They can only deliver so much. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmdqagm9pcasjtjym86q9p3a))
- Needing things to be a certain way has continually prevented me from enjoying them as they are. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmdqspxa7rzgzwn3g8qrb2gq))
- [Epictetus](https://dailystoic.com/epictetus/) says, “You can’t learn that which you think you already know.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmdqfcskdy2yvr4e3b4eakxv))

- The certainty comes later. The truly life-changing decisions are never simple. If I had only ever done things I was absolutely certain about, I’d have missed out on experiences I love. Conversely, I regret a good chunk of my “Fuck yes’s” because I was [caught up in a fit of passion](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2016/06/dont-follow-your-passion-its-whats-holding-you-back/) or bias. The whole point of risk *is that you don’t know.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmdqksf0hhtkp7md2y49785v))
