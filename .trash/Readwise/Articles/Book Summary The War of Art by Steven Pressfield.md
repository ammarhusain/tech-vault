## Highlights
- Resistance is what keeps us from sitting down and doing our best work
- “Most of us have two lives. The life we live, and the unlived life within us. Between the two stands Resistance.”
- “Resistance is experienced as fear; the degree of fear equates to the strength of Resistance. Therefore the more fear we feel about a specific enterprise, the more certain we can be that that enterprise is important to us and to the growth of our soul. That’s why we feel so much Resistance. If it meant nothing to us, there’d be no Resistance.”
- What exactly are the qualities that define us as professionals?
  We show up every day.We show up no matter what.We stay on the job all day.We are committed over the long haul.The stakes for us are high and real.We accept remuneration for our labor.We do not overidentify with our jobs.We master the technique of our jobs.We have a sense of humor about our jobs.We receive praise or blame in the real world.
- “A hack, he says, is a writer who second-guesses his audience. When the hack sits down to work, he doesn’t ask himself what’s in his own heart. He asks what the market is looking for.”
