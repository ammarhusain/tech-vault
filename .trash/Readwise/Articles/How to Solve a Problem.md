## Highlights
- When faced with a difficult problem, don’t try to solve it. Instead, make sure you understand it. If you understand it properly, the solution will be obvious. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2z3be35nt68rqjtg8eka183))
    - Note: Understand the form-context fit
- In most situations, there are a near infinite number of potential answers, yet only a few that are good. Luckily, each constraint that you map reduces the search space, making it easier to see what the right answer is.
  If you map the context well enough, the solution will reveal itself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2z3apejj1yvsba5he575hfp))
- I often got fixated on a solution before I’d actually understood the details of the problem. This is a common and strong human tendency: to distort our understanding of the problem to make our preconceived solution look like the right answer. Obviously, this makes it harder to see what the right solution is. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2z383beadyb5ezh3070v5kj))
