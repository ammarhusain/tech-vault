## Highlights
- A [neural radiance field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934) (NeRF) is a fully-connected neural network that can generate novel views of complex 3D scenes, based on a partial set of 2D images. It is trained to use a rendering loss to reproduce input views of a scene. It works by taking input images representing a scene and interpolating between them to render one complete scene. NeRF is a highly effective way to generate images for synthetic data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyjhywrvtp6z9n0pa9qv8qg3))
- A NeRF network is trained to map directly from viewing direction and spatial location (5D input) to opacity and color (4D output), using volume rendering to render new views. NeRF is a computationally-intensive algorithm, and processing of complex scenes can take hours or days. However, new algorithms are available that dramatically improve performance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyjj0b84zk5jbvry6qedraaz))
- Three common types of rendering algorithms are rasterization, which projects objects geometrically based on information in the model, without optical effects; ray casting, which calculates an image from a specific point of view using basic optical laws of reflection; and ray tracing, which uses Monte Carlo techniques to achieve a realistic image in a far shorter time. Ray tracing is used to improve rendering performance in NVIDIA GPUs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyjj69tg9cqap8nxa4vn8pce))
- A NeRF uses a sparse set of input views to optimize a continuous volumetric scene function. The result of this optimization is the ability to produce novel views of a complex scene. You can provide input for NeRF as a static set of images. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyjm3x7fw1ekjm7grpj581ka))
- A continuous scene is a 5D vector-valued function with the following characteristics:
  • Its input is a 3D location x = (x; y; z) and 2D viewing direction (θ; Φ) 
  • Its output is an emitted color c = (r; g; b) and volume density (α). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyjwxc208qt2g63qj1k1e071))
- This method uses the reconstruction of many images aligned to an approximate canonical pose with a single network conditioned on a shared latent space for learning a space of radiance fields that models shape and appearance for a class of objects.
