## Highlights
- Money has a declining utility
  I don’t want to say money has less use to us as we age, but it does in many ways. When your physical and mental abilities decrease, your ability to enjoy specific experiences also decreases. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzp9yj7csbskmt1jd7fe4g39))
- And when you engage in that experience, it brings you joy. But you also get the joy when you recall that experience. That original experience is paying you memory dividends every time you relive it.
  This is why you should consider experiences earlier because the experience plus the memory dividends add to the net fulfillment equation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzpa1cxcpkm75pmxwkb4d6sr))
- Rather than just creating a list of things you want to do before you die, consider bucketing them on a timeline based on when they’re best suited to happen. 
  Here are a few examples:
  • Backpacking around the world and sleeping on people’s couches is probably better suited for your 20s when you have a lifestyle with lesser responsibilities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzp9ztam9q8mjymzj07xrw0y))
- While I proved (to myself), it’s easy to convert time to money; sometimes my optimizer brain makes it hard to spend money to save time. But it is one of the best ways to make decisions aligned with net fulfillment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzpa32hhqdcmqf0k93ey41g2))
- My approach to money was save, save, save. And while I am grateful for the cushion it’s provided, I’ve been thinking about how greater my net fulfillment meter would be if I spent more on experiences in our 20s/30s. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzpa4d3ezxmndy3ttws4vqmr))
