## Highlights
- we develop an interactive and ﬂexible imitation learn-
  ing system that can learn from both demonstrations and interventions and can be
  conditioned on different forms of information that convey the task, including pre-
  trained embeddings of natural language or videos of humans performing the task. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpeyffyw6dj35pyxzfc0qytb))
- The policy architecture is divided into an encoder q(z|w), which processes the command w into
  an embedding z ∈ Z, and a control layer π, which processes (s, z) to produce the action a, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpf0p0edekkn5em1tgfgv9r2))
- . For each task i, this dataset
  contains expert data (s, a) ∈ Di
  e, human video data wh ∈ Di
  h, and one language command wi
  . We
  now discuss how we use this data to train the encoder q(z|w) and the control layer π(a|s, z). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpf0bx5fsr7x7cs30nhsdvyw))
