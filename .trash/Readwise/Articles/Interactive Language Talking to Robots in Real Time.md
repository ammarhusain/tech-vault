## Highlights
- We present a framework for building interactive, real-
  time, natural language-instructable robots in the real world, and we
  open source related assets (dataset, environment, benchmark, and
  policies). Trained with behavioral cloning on a dataset of hundreds
  of thousands of language-annotated trajectories, a produced policy
  can proficiently execute an order of magnitude more commands
  than previous works: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq38zwbr59w7c3cst2sprnhe))
- The dataset
  we release comprises nearly 600,000 language-labeled trajectories ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq38z73hhakyg1az59ej9epf))
- We instead ask annotators to watch the full collect video, then
  find K coherent behaviors (K=24 in our case). Annotators have
  the ability to mark the start and end frame of each behavior, and
  are asked to phrase their text descriptions as natural language
  commands. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq3af69sxm5cckah3nbhgk52))
