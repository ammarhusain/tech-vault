## Highlights
- Picking the right thing to work on is the most important element of productivity and usually almost ignored.  So think about it more! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpazwr40ppb7y3br6rz969p))
- I make sure to leave enough time in my schedule to think about what to work on.  The best ways for me to do this are reading books, hanging out with interesting people, and spending time in nature. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpb1xcq88y5hq0q7hge2v43))
- I’ve been very fortunate to find work I like so much I’d do it for free, which makes it easy to be really productive. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpb3ed2a7ygy7de6cjdvqp7))
- My system has three key pillars: “Make sure to get the important shit done”, “Don’t waste time on stupid shit”, and “make a lot of lists”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpb7hhd32kec1sehvx0v6tj))
- I try to prioritize in a way that generates momentum.  The more I get done, the better I feel, and then the more I get done.  I like to start and end each day with something I can really make progress on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpb91err2n9z5bx6eybnckc))
- I don’t think most people value their time enough—I am surprised by the number of people I know who make $100 an hour and yet will spend a couple of hours doing something they don’t want to do to save $20. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpbb2ctvxtwzpeg5j35hg6n))
- Also, don’t fall into the trap of productivity porn—chasing productivity for its own sake isn’t helpful.  Many people spend too much time thinking about how to perfectly optimize their system, and not nearly enough asking if they’re working on the right problems. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpbbkxtftq6m6q4bejc44br))
- Like most people, I sometimes go through periods of a week or two where I just have no motivation to do anything (I suspect it may have something to do with nutrition).  This sucks and always seems to happen at inconvenient times ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpbzrqabm2dyt4y3y1k80e4))
- Don’t neglect your family and friends for the sake of productivity—that’s a very stupid tradeoff (and very likely a net productivity loss, because you’ll be less happy).  Don’t neglect doing things you love or that clear your head either.
