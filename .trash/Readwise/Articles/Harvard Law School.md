## Highlights
- compared to some of the individual litigants, New York Times and Getty Images have the advantage of having deep pockets and in-house legal teams. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwbkv0dz6bvjaxmcxvgbg4p2))
- **How should we weigh the need to compensate content creators for their work while also encouraging the development of new technology?**
  **Kortz:** These are all really fair concerns. In theory, OpenAI only needs to copy each New York Times article once, and it can essentially reuse them forever. That seems a little unfair. During the Screenwriters Guild strikes, one of the things they were opposed to was companies saying that if they owned the rights to a screenplay, they could use that to train AI to create future screenplays. There is the same concern for voice actors: that rather than pay someone to do voiceovers for commercials or cartoons or whatever, a company will have them come in and, for minimal pay, record 10 hours of saying random things be able to use their voice in perpetuity with AI tools. The displacement concern is very real. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwbm0b1yrmhztda46v2wh87e))
- Overall, I agree that there’s a high potential for individual writers, artists, and actors to suffer here. But I don’t necessarily think that the big companies that for the moment are aligning against the AI developers really have the little guys’ interests in mind all the time.
