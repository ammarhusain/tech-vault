## Highlights
- One common way for a good idea to be non-obvious is for it to be hidden in the
  shadow of some mistaken assumption that people are very attached to.
- Every cherished mistaken assumption has
  a dead zone of unexplored ideas around it. And the more preposterous
  the assumption, the bigger the dead zone it creates.
