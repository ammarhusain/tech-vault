## Highlights
- Parti and Imagen are complementary in exploring two different families of generative models – autoregressive and diffusion, respectively – opening exciting opportunities for combinations of these two powerful models.
- Pathways Autoregressive Text-to-Image model (Parti), an autoregressive text-to-image generation model that achieves high-fidelity photorealistic image generation and supports content-rich synthesis involving complex compositions and world knowledge.
- Parti treats text-to-image generation as a sequence-to-sequence modeling problem, analogous to machine translation – this allows it to benefit from advances in large language models, especially capabilities that are unlocked by scaling data and model sizes. In this case, the target outputs are sequences of image tokens instead of text tokens in another language. Parti uses the powerful image tokenizer, ViT-VQGAN, to encode images as sequences of discrete tokens, and takes advantage of its ability to reconstruct such image token sequences as high quality, visually diverse images.
