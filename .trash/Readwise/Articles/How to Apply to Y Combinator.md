## Highlights
- Better to start with an overly narrow description of your project than try to describe it in its full generality and lose the audience completely. If there’s a simple one-sentence description of what you’re doing that only conveys half your potential, that’s actually pretty good. You’re halfway to your destination in just the first sentence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1qaapkt2pg6f369gz52v8dy))
- One good trick for describing a project concisely is to explain it as a variant of something the audience already knows. It’s like Wikipedia, but within an organization. It’s like an answering service, but for email. It’s eBay for jobs. This form of description is wonderfully efficient. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1qabcve447kvv7c7ncfpkzg))
