## Highlights
- Yahoo had two problems
  Google didn't: easy money, and ambivalence about being a technology
  company.
- It wasn't just Yahoo. All the search engines were doing it. This
  was why they were trying to get people to start calling them "portals"
  instead of "search engines." Despite the actual meaning of the word
  portal, what they meant by it was a site where users would find
  what they wanted on the site itself, instead of just passing through
  on their way to other destinations, as they did at a search engine.
- So why
  did they call themselves a media company?One reason was the way they made money: by selling ads. In 1995
  it was hard to imagine a technology company making money that way.
  Technology companies made money by selling their software to users.
  Media companies sold ads. So they must be a media company.Another big factor was the fear of Microsoft. If anyone at Yahoo
  considered the idea that they should be a technology company, the
  next thought would have been that Microsoft would crush them.
