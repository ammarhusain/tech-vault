## Highlights
- **Court rejection**
  Ask for things. Ask for things that feel *unreasonable*, to make sure your intuitions about what’s reasonable are accurate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpg67kq05tp9ba04v346nk7d))
- If you aren’t trying to get real feedback from people who know you, you’re cooking without tasting. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpg67ynbvdhwsd8bwt6byp3n))
- **Increase your surface area for luck**
  The last couple times I was looking for a project, I made a point of meeting as many people doing related work as I could, even if there was no obvious benefit to doing so. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpg68p4ybe036v1gm71jgdy8))
- **Assume everything is learnable**
  Most subject matter is learnable, even stuff that seems really hard. But beyond that, many (most?) traits that people treat as fixed are actually quite malleable ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpg6cbq12ncb59hm76jtjetx))
- making changes in your life, especially when learning new skill sets, requires you to cross a moat of low status, a period of time where you are actually bad at the thing or fail to know things that are obvious to other people.
