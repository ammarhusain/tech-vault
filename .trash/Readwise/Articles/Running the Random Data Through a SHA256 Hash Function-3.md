## Highlights
- The only parameter that can be changed is the source of entropy. This is important because if the source of entropy is corrupted, an attacker can potentially regenerate your wallet and steal your funds.Generating entropy, which is random data, can be done manually or with a computer. Both methods have pros and cons. When generating entropy, care has to be taken to ensure the process is being done correctly and is free from manipulation.
