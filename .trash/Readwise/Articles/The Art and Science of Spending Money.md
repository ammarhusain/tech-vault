## Highlights
- Money is so complicated. There’s a human element that can defy logic – it’s personal, it’s messy, it’s emotional. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxdparbgmv0qp7kan9hph3p))
- Welch’s story shows how much deeper the psychology of money can go. How you spend money can reveal an existential struggle of what you find valuable in life, who you want to spend time with, why you chose your career, and the kind of attention you want from other people. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxdq5a73wv94wzvgk31mew3))
- Frugality inertia: a lifetime of good savings habits can’t be transitioned to a spending phase. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxe8mrcrx0yp0dzcxy54nnh))
- If you develop an early system of savings and living well below your means – congratulations, you’ve won. But if you can never break away from that system, and insist on a heavy savings regimen well into your retirement years … what is that? Is it still winning? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxebeqetr90bmhpj66rymjd))
- Ramit Sethi says too many people ask $3 questions (can I afford this latte?) when all that matters to financial success are $30,000 questions (what college should I go to?) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxeq23x6e9txkhyccdqwmva))
- Parkinson’s Law of Triviality. It states: “The amount of attention a problem gets is the inverse of its importance.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxen7qmvjgjyr3cxve88p1q))
- If you want to know what lower-income groups will aspire to spend their money on in the future, look at what higher-income groups exclusively do today. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxet7xrawywhrn8pay5khn7))
- People like to mimic others, especially those who appear to be living better lives. Always been like that, always will be. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxevshv2v96vts9vrvcfbbj))
- People generally aspire to be respected and admired by others, and using money to buy fancy things may bring less of it than you imagine. If respect and admiration are your goal, be careful how you seek it. Humility, kindness, and empathy will bring you more respect than horsepower ever will. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxf2x4h8av0rzn48bwzg7kb))
- Psychologist Jonathan Haidt says people don’t communicate on social media; they perform for one another. Spending money is like that, too. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxfgs1js1nq7ta6epyhpw3e))
- Montesquieu wrote 275 years ago, “If you only wished to be happy, this could be easily accomplished; but we wish to be happier than other people, and this is always difficult, for we believe others to be happier than they are.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxfmztv5v58f724wzm8k0dn))
- Spending money to make you happy is hard if you’re already happy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxfqgacc6sjj7p1aa8dc79f))
