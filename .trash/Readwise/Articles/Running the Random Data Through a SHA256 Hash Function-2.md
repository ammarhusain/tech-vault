## Highlights
- The process of generating a seed phrase starts with generating random data, called entropy. The entropy is then run through a hashing function, specifically SHA256, to generate the checksum. Part of the checksum is then appended to the random data. The resulting output is then split into chunks of 11 bits, where each 11-bit chunk maps to a single word on the BIP39 word list.
