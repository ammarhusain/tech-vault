## Highlights
- Book value is equal to the cost of carrying an asset on a company's balance sheet, and firms calculate it netting the asset against its [accumulated depreciation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accumulated-depreciation.asp). As a result, book value can also be thought of as the net asset value (NAV) of a company, calculated as its total assets minus [intangible assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intangibleasset.asp) (patents, goodwill) and liabilities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grfkzcjtmzy4jg2mkydhv9qw))
- The book value of a company is the net difference between that company's total assets and total liabilities, where book value reflects the total value of a company's assets that shareholders of that company would receive if the company were to be liquidated. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grfm0a5rcdf56v0e87haa31j))
- As the accounting value of a firm, book value has two main uses:
  1. It serves as the total value of the company's assets that shareholders would theoretically receive if a company was [liquidated](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidation-value.asp).
  2. When compared to the company's [market value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketvalue.asp), book value can indicate whether a stock is under- or overpriced. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grfm5xsev3p73cwvz7tgdqth))
- There are limitations to how accurately book value can be a proxy to the shares' market worth when [mark to market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marktomarket.asp) valuation is not applied to assets that may experience increases or decreases of their market values. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grfmgnsk935kxq4cc5eyas3y))
    - Note: In simple terms mark to market means whether the assets value is constantly adjusted to reflect its current market price or it says fixed to some historical price, say when the house was purchased for example.
- Book value only considers the cost to liquidate a firm's fixed assets and securities. It does not consider intangible assets such as patents, intellectual property, brand value, and goodwill. It also does not account for workers' skills and human capital. Moreover, it doesn't account for how a firm's assets will generate profits and growth over time. Therefore, the market value, which takes into consideration all of these things, will generally be higher. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grfmg2eb4z8kvgrhc8rnbfyc))
