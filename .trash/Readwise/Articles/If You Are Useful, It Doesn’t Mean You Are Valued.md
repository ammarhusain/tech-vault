## Highlights
- Being *useful* means that you are good at getting things done in a specific area, so that people above you can delegate that completely.

- Being *valued*, on the other hand, means that you are brought into more conversations, not just to execute, but to help shape the direction. This comes with opportunities to grow and contribute in ways that are meaningful to you and the business. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxqd6wr0gyd3xgxspa1y2bev))
