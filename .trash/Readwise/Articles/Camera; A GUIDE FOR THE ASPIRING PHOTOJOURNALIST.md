## Highlights
- The moral of this story is basic to the entire structure of photojournalism. There were other capable photographers there; but only Salomon exercised the ingenuity to overcome seemingly impossible odds to complete his assignment and deliver the pictures on time.
- Essential to the success of any photojournalist is the photographic equipment he has available. Most professionals own four to six camera bodies (single-lens reflex cameras are among the most popular) and a variety of lenses ranging from extreme wide-angle (18mm, 24mm, 28mm, 35mm) to special purpose lenses and telephotos ranging up to 400, 500, and 1000mm.
- In this tough, highly competitive field the personality of the photographer is very intimately involved with how the customer accepts the finished product, and the psychology of selling yourself is based on convincing your potential client that you are better suited to handling the forthcoming job than any one of a dozen other seasoned professionals that are after the same assignment. That calls for salesmanship of a very high order, plus an engaging personality and a convincing manner.
