## Highlights
- This document is arranged in four parts: 1. The first part should help you understand whether the time is right for building a machine learning system.
  2. The second part is about deploying your first pipeline. 3. The third part is about launching and iterating while adding new features to your pipeline, how to evaluate models and training­serving skew.
  4. The final part is about what to do when you reach a plateau. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzz6q3hehscrq5b0ef0ccsgn))
- First, design and implement metrics. Before formalizing what your machine learning system will do, track as much as possible in your current system. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzz6my5bf7kggxk2jrw125cw))
- Choose machine learning over a complex heuristic. A simple heuristic can get your product out the door. A complex heuristic is unmaintainable. Once you have data and a basic idea of what you are trying to accomplish, move on to machine learning. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzz6p2sy6kefvknbrxtca8az))
- Keep the first model simple and get the infrastructure right. The first model provides the biggest boost to your product, so it doesn't need to be fancy. But you will run into many more infrastructure issues than you expect. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzz6v0fvj4ntwy7a90r8k7k6))
- Rule #12: Don’t overthink which objective you choose to directly optimize. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzz7gs41abh2975w6cnz5021))
- The ML objective should be something that is easy to measure and is a proxy for the “true” objective . So train on the simple ML objective, and consider having a "policy layer" on top that allows you to add additional logic (hopefully very simple logic) to do the final ranking. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzz7symb7mzfqq07nggwmb0d))
- Rule #14: Starting with an interpretable model makes debugging easier. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzz7qaznkbne1c5q47aavxrk))
- The general rule is “measure first, optimize second”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzz8bzt94fgax0m2vpx96aqm))
- Rule #32: Re­use code between your training pipeline and your serving pipeline whenever possible ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzz8hxej4t3dsdthqydxebe1))
- When performance plateaus, look for qualitatively new sources of information to add rather than refining existing signals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzz8rvqp8zbqqhy0v51qbfy3))
