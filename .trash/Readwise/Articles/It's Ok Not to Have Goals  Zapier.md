## Highlights
- Star Trek is set in a future without scarcity. Technology means there's plenty of food and energy for everyone, so the only reason to work is self-improvement—to become better at something for its own sake. People work hard anyway because it's fulfilling to them. That's enough. It's a utopia built around the idea that people aren't primarily motivated by need: they're motivated by achievement and learning.
- And this can translate to your career—you don't need goals to feel motivated. Getting better at what you do can be motivation enough, and that's what I'm focusing on.
