## Highlights
- The more money you have, the more you have to preserve. And the more you have to preserve, the more fear that surrounds its potential loss.
- The avoidance of failure is just as powerful as our will to preserve. That’s because failure is deeply connected with our sense of self, and how we believe others also perceive that self. And since money is measurable and trackable, it’s easy to use it as a proxy for whether you’re growing or stagnating. But of course, the mistake we often make is to associate it with individual progress as a whole.
- If you can regularly decouple psychological angst from the reality of your biological safety, then that will go a long way in managing the survival instinct of money.
