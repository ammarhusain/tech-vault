- Remember: You didn’t choose your genes, your parents, your upbringing, your interests. Pretty much everything of consequence is the result of happenstance, and that is where we all begin. We’re equipped with a mind and body that we didn’t choose, yet the temptation is to believe that we know who we are ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt794gqdv4rkmnrjj0t6gj2c))
