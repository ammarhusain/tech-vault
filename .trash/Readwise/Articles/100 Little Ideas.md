## Highlights
- **Buridan’s Ass**: A thirsty donkey is placed exactly midway between two pails of water. It dies because it can’t make a rational decision about which one to choose. A form of decision paralysis.
  **Pareto Principle**: The majority of outcomes are driven by a minority of events. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5kk48vwvv6vq91a4aqt1vm))
## New highlights: [[2024-01-20-Saturday]] at 11:00 AM
- **Ringelmann Effect**: Members of a group become lazier as the size of their group increases. Based on the assumption that “someone else is probably taking care of that.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmky1vr8rwkfnsbtnfcn5tpr))
- **Boomerang Effect:** Trying to persuade someone to do one thing can make them more likely to do the opposite, because the act of persuasion can feel like someone stealing your freedom and doing the opposite makes you feel like you’re taking your freedom back. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmky3pt9zq08amng177pk6by))
- **Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon**: Noticing an idea everywhere you look as soon as it’s brought to your attention in a way that makes you overestimate its prevalence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmkyeyfrvfqeqmx50dbwmf48))
- **Apophenia**: A tendency to perceive correlations between unrelated things, because your mind can only deal with tiny sample sizes and assuming things are correlated creates easy/comforting explanations of how the world works. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmkyehy1bxzr2431tcnzycdh))
- **Hanlon’s Razor:** “Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmkyf8n1rcd4z45gxmnwzg9n))
    - Tags: #readwise/favorite 
- **Weasel Words**: Phrases that appear to have meaning but convey nothing tangible. “Growth was solid last quarter,” or “Many people believe.”
  **Hormesis**: Something that hurts you in a high dose can be good for you in small doses. (Weight on your bones, drinking red wine, etc.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmkzdyhwxayk4wq5xrhkc4h0))
- **Peter Principle:** Good workers will continue to be promoted until they end up in a role they’re bad at.
  **Friendship Paradox**: On average, people have fewer friends than their friends have. Occurs because people with an abnormally high number of friends are more likely to be one of your friends. It’s a fundamental part of social network dynamics and makes most people feel less popular than they are. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmkzgxms5cp8jzebdpbc89h6))
- **Hedonic Treadmill**: Expectations rise with results, so nothing feels as good as you’d imagine for as long as you’d expect.
  **Positive Illusions**: Excessively rosy views about the decisions you’ve made to maintain self-esteem in a world where everyone makes bad decisions all the time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmkzmyyv8hnnrrc383ts4g9s))
