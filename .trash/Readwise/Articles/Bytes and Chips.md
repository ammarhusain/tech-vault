## Highlights
- And in just a matter of weeks a couple of men in their twenties from Los Altos, California, the next town over from Mountain View, will start selling Apple II, which Helmers calls the first appliance computer—a fully assembled briefcase-size unit, with a large memory and a keyboard, that can play any number of computer games, draw pictures on your color TV, and operate like any other computer, using the TV as its display. Cost of Apple II: thirteen hundred dollars. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp6h7bc2p5zva3h3br54mb8j))
- “People will be able to do their home bookkeeping, they’ll be able to program their home computer to maintain a constant temperature in the apartment, and to start the coffeepot in the morning—eggs over easy will still be a human function—and then they’ll start hooking their machines in with their friends’ machines, and people will get on nets of computers, which could mean you could vote or buy something while sitting at your own computer keyboard. Games are the big thing at the moment, but what’s interesting to me is that people with little or no electronics background are getting into the field and, since they’ve never been instructed about what the computer can’t do, they’re already trying crazy things and coming up with completely unheard-of uses for computers.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp6h45vm454rjhmsmbransvp))
- The breakthrough came when Intel, a Silicon Valley firm ... came up with significant improvements in the design of microcircuitry (circuits so small you need a microscope to see them). Intel started manufacturing silicon chips only two-tenths of an inch on a side which could contain up to twenty thousand transistors. When the chips first came out, in 1973, they were going for a hundred and fifty dollars apiece. Now they’re available for fifteen dollars apiece.
