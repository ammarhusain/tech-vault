## Highlights
- When presented with a fresh problem, AlphaCode generates candidate code solutions (in Python or C++) and filters out the bad ones. But whereas researchers had previously used models like Codex to generate tens or hundreds of candidates, DeepMind had AlphaCode generate up to more than 1 million.
  To filter them, AlphaCode first keeps only the 1% of programs that pass test cases that accompany problems. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmsmksrmtgwerb5gn9j8c1af))
- After training, AlphaCode [solved about 34% of assigned problems](http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq1158?adobe_mc=MCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1670982433), DeepMind reports this week in *Science*. (On similar benchmarks, Codex achieved single-digit-percentage success.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmsmm98zd2jnwv06w9jv98an))
- “It continues to be impressive how well machine-learning methods do when you scale them up,” he says. The results are “stunning,” adds Wojciech Zaremba, a co-founder of OpenAI and co-author of their Codex paper. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmsmscnpq6w0fttav04f5aef))
