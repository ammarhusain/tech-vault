## Highlights
- to achieve anything in life, you must *become* the person who both sees that as a possibility and has the skill to achieve it.
  How your mind interprets the world is largely dependent on your *identity or who you are.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpzeyy81pqektmj351m71b8d))
- Your identity isn’t some set-in-stone thing that you were assigned at birth along with your name. It’s a living, breathing, and evolving entity.
  You aren’t helpless.
  You’ve just learned to be. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpzexcrqddt1yyk3cghaczfg))
- Mistakes are the only source of truth.
  Not the thoughts in your head. Not the advice of a billionaire.
  Failure is the only teacher that is absolutely 100% tailored to your situation.
  Failure has a signal to noise ratio or 100:1.

  You ignore it and dig your head into more courses, books, and podcasts.
  Everything you learn that is not derived from mistakes is derived from theory. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpzf3c25nhf7v8nvdt1p5r7d))
