- Step 5: Create your game plan. ... Defining your plan needs to include the tangible and intangible characteristics of personal branding including attire, hair, makeup, behavior, verbal and non-verbal communication.
- **Step 6: Manage your brand.** Proactively manage all aspects of your brand, ensuring these aspects are in sync and that they continue to reinforce your brand attributes ... your Tweets and any social media posts should stay within your market niche and your in-person behavior should be representative of how you want others to perceive you.
