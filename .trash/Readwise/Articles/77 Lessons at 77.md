## Highlights
- Everything starts with vision. You have to see it before you can achieve it. You will never regret the time you spend to develop a very clear vision. When I say clear, I mean so clear that it plays in your mind like a movie. Before I stepped on a bodybuilding stage, I saw myself standing on the podium holding the trophy. It was like a memory — one that just hadn’t happened yet. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j565c1jgmsespcrhv0b0595b))
- Your vision will grow and change throughout your life. I love the story of Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person to climb Mount Everest. The press asked him about the view at the top, and he told them that he saw another peak he’d never seen before and started planning how he’d climb that mountain. When you find success, more doors will open. You can find yourself passionate about something you would have never imagined 20 years earlier. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j565hmv1gv9k9bpqsgpqbr68))
- The joy is not in the victory or in standing at the top of the mountain.
  The joy is the work that gets you there. If you think that the success you envision is the key to happiness, you’re going to be very disappointed when you achieve it. Once you learn to love the work, you’ll never have to worry about being happy or fulfilled because there is always work to be done.

## New highlights: [[2024-08-14-Wednesday]] at 9:49 AM
- You are going to fail. If you do it right, you will fail over and over throughout your life. Accept it now. Failure is a crucial part of success. No one ever lifted 500 pounds without failing over and over. Don’t be afraid of failure. Like discomfort, make failure your friend. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j58nkvn6wgqrdsrm8hs2t36s))
- Your mind will also exaggerate the embarrassment of failure. It’s important to be honest with yourself about this. First, very few people will know you failed. Second, anyone who knows you failed and takes joy in it — schadenfreude — wasn’t going to cheer for your success anyway, so why do you care what they think? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j58npqt3sxkbkgrt90tc3rvg))
- In fact, most of the time, nothing matters. Focus on the basics. Focus on what you can control. Nothing else matters. I will have people who have never worked out in their life come up to me and ask, “Should I do a push-pull split, or a bodybuilding split, or full body workouts?” I say, “It doesn’t matter.
  Anything is more than you’re doing now. Just do something.” People will ask about supplements to help their diet when all they eat is processed food. It doesn’t matter. Get the basics right! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j58p8bpj5dr76vekvmmm5z8z))
- Sell, sell, sell. No matter what you do in life, you need to learn to sell. Whether you have a product or whether you are the product, we all have to sell something. Become comfortable with selling. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j58pharrz2bpxazdgxfngzf0))
- Develop a sense of humor about yourself, too. The more you can laugh at yourself, the happier you’ll be. When you fail a lift or you screw something up, practice laughing at yourself instead of beating yourself up. We all can take ourselves too seriously. One way to stress just a little less about life is to laugh at yourself instead of beating yourself up. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j58q2n0vwhsm6zw7zn5vstps))
- You need momentum, not motivation. No matter how fired up you are, motivation will run out. Believe me. I’ve been training for 62 years. There is no motivation that lasts that long. There are going to be days — probably soon — when you don’t want to get out of bed. Those are the days when you need momentum, not motivation. You need a routine. It is going to suck. Just do it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j58q8w573h1vpcx9vc7aac8s))
- On those days when you feel really hopeless about the world, just go and do something for someone else. Buy a sandwich for a homeless person. Trust me, the second you bring a little positivity into someone’s life, you’ll feel it in your own life. And you’ll prove to yourself that you do have the power to make things better, even if it’s for one person for a few minutes.
