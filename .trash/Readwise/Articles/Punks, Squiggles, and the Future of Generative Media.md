## Highlights
- During the last ten years, blockchains have changed the game for immutable digital files. Bitcoin has illustrated that digital scarcity is possible in the realm of money. Ethereum extended the concept of digital scarcity beyond commodity money, enabling the information of any digital good (3D objects, music, files, GIFs, memes) to be tied to a unique “non-fungible” token (NFT). For the first time, creative digital works could enjoy verifiable scarcity, empowering the artist to endow authenticity and salability to downstream collectors of a digital creation.
- Inspired by CryptoPunks, the Ethereum community created a standard called ERC-721, for Non-Fungible Tokens. While CryptoPunks were traded primarily on the Larva Labs platform, future NFTs utilizing the new standards would enjoy the benefits of composability.
- In November 2020, Snowfro launched Art Blocks, the internet’s first marketplace for on-demand, on-chain, generative media. In the time between the launch of CryptoPunks and Art Blocks, pioneer on-chain art projects like Autoglyphs proved that artists could store more of the art “on the chain”, which validated Snowfro’s design decisions around NFT permanence for a generative art platform.
- When a buyer identifies a collection they like, they pay to mint a unique output of that work, much like a vending machine for unique art. Except, you don’t know what’s going to pop out of the machine when you hit the button. Artists watch the mints unfold with as much fascination as the collectors.
- Similar to CryptoPunks, the demand for each unique generative piece (as well as the overall collection) is driven by context around the artist, aesthetics, perspective, the rarity of traits presented in the work, and the total number of mints that can ever exist.
