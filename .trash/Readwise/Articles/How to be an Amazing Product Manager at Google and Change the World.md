## Highlights
- Product managers own the product lifecycle, which includes defining the product roadmap, working closely with the engineering team on feature specifications, representing the voice of the user, andmaking decisions about implementation and resource trade-offs. Product managers are responsible for effectivecommunication across the company, starting with engineers andincluding the executive team, corporate communications, marketing, sales, user support,webmasters, and more.
- Insights can come from knowing how people use Internet technology and how that is changing practically every day with new devices and new apps. Insights can also come from a deep understanding of data. Or, insights can come from applying a new technical solution to a known problem.
- For users--the new Google standard is a “just works” user interface that is beautifully simple, ruthlessly efficient and magically hides the complexity behind the product. Think about the most popular iPad apps--they are quick, enjoyable to use, reliable and utterly intuitive. Compare your user interface to the very best and remember that to win it needs to be simple and fast (simplicity and speed are two sides of the same coin), while also giving power users the flexibility they need.
- If you don't measure it, you can't manage it. Make sure you measure, log, and analyze the key metrics of your product and set up a feedback loop for continuous improvement.
- If you can get data and don’t have it, that’s not a good thing● Manage what you can control--do a great job with the thing you’ve been assigned
