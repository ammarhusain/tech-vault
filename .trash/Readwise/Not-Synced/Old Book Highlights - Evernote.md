# Atomic Habits (Summary)

“The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.”

“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”

“People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.”

“One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.”
Goodhart’s Law states, ‘When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.’”

“The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.”

# Miracle Morning

It’s been said that the first hour is the rudder of the day.
Life Purpose: Be louder & self confident in the way I carry myself.

- “How you do anything is how you do everything.”
- Always remember that who you’re becoming is far more important than what you’re doing, and yet it is what you’re doing that is determining who you’re becoming.

# Siddhartha (August 2018)

Meaning of life cannot be taught, it needs to be self discovered. Dont seek teachers to teach you, or if you do something or get somewhere all troubles will stop. You have to learn to live as you go.

- Deflation is worse than inflation. People would not take paycuts if price of goods is going down. Inflation @ 3% is healthy and the Feds job to maintain that level.
