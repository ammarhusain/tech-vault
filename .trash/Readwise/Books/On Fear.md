## Highlights
- Fear is never an actuality; it is either before or after the active present. ([Location 34](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=34))
- There, at that actual moment, there is total attention at the moment of danger, physical or psychological. When there is complete attention there is no fear. But the actual fact of inattention breeds fear; fear arises when there is an avoidance of the fact, a flight; ([Location 36](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=36))
- we don’t actually listen to people, we just casually listen and come to some kind of conclusion, or seek explanations, but we never actually listen to what somebody else is saying. We are always translating what others are saying. ([Location 58](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=58))
- When you compare yourself with another, ideologically, psychologically, or even physically, there is the striving to become that; and there is the fear that you may not. It is the desire to fulfil and you may not be able to fulfil. Where there is comparison there must be fear. ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=74))
- If those are the contributory factors of fear, and you are concerned with the ending of fear, then inwardly there is no comparison, which means there is no becoming. The very meaning of the comparison is to become that which you think is better, higher, nobler, and so on. ([Location 80](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=80))
- Why introduce the factor of its being wrong? ([Location 93](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=93))
    - Tags: #readwise/typo 
- Most of us crave the satisfaction of having a position in society because we are afraid of being nobody. Society is so constructed that a citizen who has a position of respect is treated with great courtesy, whereas a man who has no position is kicked around. ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=101))
- Inwardly we are whirlpools of misery and mischief and therefore, to be regarded outwardly as a great figure is very gratifying. This craving for position, for prestige, for power, to be recognized by society as being outstanding in some way, is a wish to dominate others, and this wish to dominate is a form of aggression. ([Location 104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=104))
- Fear is one of the greatest problems in life. A mind that is caught in fear lives in confusion, in conflict, and therefore must be violent, distorted, and aggressive. ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=108))
- We are all afraid of something; there is no fear in abstraction, it is always in relation to something. Do you know your own fears— ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=115))
- One of the major causes of fear is that we do not want to face ourselves as we are. ([Location 121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=121))
- The movement from certainty to uncertainty is what I call fear. ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=129))
- So what we are afraid of is the repetition of the old—the thought of what has been projecting into the future. Therefore, thought is responsible for fear. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=152))
- When you are confronted with something immediately there is no fear. It is only when thought comes in that there is fear. Therefore, our question now is, is it possible for the mind to live completely, totally, in the present? It is only such a mind that has no fear. ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=153))
- One of the functions of thought is to be occupied all the time with something. Most of us want to have our minds continually occupied so that we are prevented from seeing ourselves as we actually are. We are afraid to be empty. We are afraid to look at our fears. ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=163))
- When you understand that fear is a single movement that expresses itself in different ways, and when you see the movement and not the object to which the movement goes, then you are facing an immense question: How can you look at it without the fragmentation that the mind has cultivated? ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=174))
- Can the mind perceive fear and not the different forms of fear—perceive total fear, not what you are afraid of? If you look merely at the details of fear or try to deal with your fears one by one, you will never come to the central issue, which is to learn to live with fear. ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=190))
- When you see that you are a part of fear, not separate from it—that you are fear—then you cannot do anything about it; then fear comes totally to an end. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=206))
- Comparison breeds fear. Do observe this fact in yourself. I want to be a better writer, or a more beautiful and intelligent person. I want to have more knowledge than others; I want to be successful, to become somebody, to have more fame in the world. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=239))
- I depend on something because that something fills my emptiness. I depend on knowledge, on books, because that covers my emptiness, my shallowness, my stupidity; so knowledge becomes extraordinarily important. ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=376))
## New highlights: [[2023-05-21-Sunday]] at 3:48 AM
- realize I am frightened—why? Is it because I see that I am dead? I am living in the past and I don’t know what it means to observe and live in the present; therefore, this is something totally new and I am frightened to do anything new. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=403))
- Either you repress it or escape from it; there is a conflict between fear and wanting to get rid of it, isn’t there? So there is either repression or escape; and in trying to get rid of it there is conflict, which only increases fear. ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=421))
- But psychologically it is much more difficult to become completely secure. So I seek that security in a belief, in a conclusion, in nationality, in a family, or in my experience, and when that experience, that family, that belief is threatened, there is fear. There is fear when I have to face psychological danger, which is uncertainty, meeting something I don’t know, the tomorrow. Then there is fear. And there is fear also when I am comparing myself with you whom I think are greater. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=521))
- An image is an idea, a memory, a recollection, a remembrance. If I really want to be free of fear, I have to destroy my image about her, and she has to destroy her image about me. ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=613))
- Fear is something in relation to something else. Fear does not exist by itself. It exists in relation to a snake, to what my parents might say to a teacher, to death; it is in connection with something. ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=698))
- Surely fear is in the movement away from ‘what is’; it is the flight, the escape, the avoidance of, actually, that brings about fear. Also, when there is comparison, of any kind, there is the breeding of fear—the comparison of what you are with what you think you should be. So fear is in the movement away from what is actual, not in the object from which you move away. ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=750))
- So analysis is not the way. When you see the truth of that, it means you are no longer thinking in terms of the analyser who is going to analyse, going to judge and evaluate, and your mind is free of that particular burden called analysis; therefore, it is capable of looking directly. ([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=773))
- Fear is always in relation to something; it does not exist by itself. There is fear of what happened yesterday in relation to the possibility of its repetition tomorrow; there is always a fixed point from which relationship takes place. ([Location 781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=781))
- The moment there is no fear, there is no ambition, but there is an action, which is for the love of the thing but not for recognition of the thing that you are doing. ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=809))

- I have to find out what the relationship of thought is in action; and to find out if thought need interfere when there is no need of thought at all. I see a beautiful tree, without a single leaf, against the sky; it is extraordinarily beautiful and that is enough—finished. Why should thought come in and say, ‘I must have that same delight tomorrow’? ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=999))
- your consciousness is the rest of mankind. Mankind, like you and others, goes through every form of difficulty, pain, travail, anxiety, loneliness, depression, sorrow, pleasure—every human being goes through this—every human being all over the world. So our consciousness, our being, is the entire humanity. ([Location 1625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D5TL30E&location=1625))
