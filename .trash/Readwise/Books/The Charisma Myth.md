- Imagine yourself as a scientist investigating this experience. Name the sensations you feel. Observe them as objectively as you can. See them purely as physical sensations, like hot ([Location 967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=967))
- Self-compassion is how much warmth we can have for ourselves, especially when we’re going through a difficult experience. ([Location 1309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1309))
- Self-compassion is what helps us forgive ourselves when we’ve fallen short; it’s what prevents internal criticism from taking over and playing across our face, ([Location 1324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1324))
- Self-criticism is much stronger when our suffering seems due to our own perceived failures and inadequacies than when it seems due to external circumstances. ([Location 1345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1345))
- Create your own music playlist for the internal state you’d like to have. You could make one for energy and confidence, one that makes you feel warm and empathetic, and another that makes you feel calm and serene. ([Location 1488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1488))
- Focus Charisma: Presence and Confidence ([Location 1522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1522))
- Visionary Charisma: Belief and Confidence ([Location 1558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1558))
- Kindness Charisma: Warmth and Confidence ([Location 1582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1582))
- too comfortable and share too much (thankfully, you have chapter 13 to help you avoid this). Authority Charisma: Status and Confidence ([Location 1609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1609))
- YOU NEVER GET a second chance to make a great first impression. Within a few seconds, with just a glance, people have judged your social and economic level, your level of education, and even your level of success. Within minutes, they’ve also decided your levels of intelligence, trustworthiness, competence, friendliness, and confidence. ([Location 1745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1745))
- The right handshake costs far less and will do far more for you than a designer suit can. Having a great handshake is critical to authority charisma—can you imagine a powerful figure with a limp, weak handshake? ([Location 1821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1821))
- even when you’re speaking, the one word that should pop up most often in your conversation is not I but you. Instead of saying “I read a great article on that subject in the New York Times,” try “You might enjoy the recent New York Times article on the subject.” ([Location 1886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1886))
- Another way to exit a conversation with grace is to offer something of value: Information: an article, book, or Web site you think might be of use to them A connection: someone they ought to meet whom you know and can introduce them to Visibility: an organization you belong to, where you could invite them to speak ([Location 1904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1904))
- You already have all the tools you need to avoid mind-wandering while someone else is talking: If zoning out is the issue, bring yourself back to the moment by focusing on physical sensations, like the feeling in your toes or your breath flowing in and out of your body. If impatience is the issue, handle it by delving into the minute physical sensations you’re feeling. Then get back to the person. ([Location 1956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1956))
- If zoning out is the issue, bring yourself back to the ([Location 1957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1957))
- moment by focusing on physical sensations, like the feeling in your toes or your breath flowing in and out of your body. If impatience is the issue, handle it by delving into the minute physical sensations you’re feeling. Then get back to the person. ([Location 1957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1957))
- Good listeners know never, ever to interrupt—not even if the impulse to do so comes from excitement about something the other person just said. ([Location 1961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1961))
- People really do love to hear themselves talk. The more you let them speak, the more they will like you. ([Location 1967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1967))
- Master listeners know one extra trick, one simple but extraordinarily effective habit that will make people feel truly listened to and understood: they pause before they answer. ([Location 1970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1970))
- they pause before they answer. ([Location 1971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1971))
- The sequence goes like this: They finish their sentence Your face absorbs Your face reacts Then, and only then, you answer ([Location 1978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1978))
- It takes confidence to bear silence, both because of the awkwardness you may feel and because of the uncertainty of not knowing what they’re thinking during those two seconds. ([Location 1979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=1979))
- Benjamin Disraeli’s genius was his ability to make whomever he was speaking with feel intelligent and fascinating. People would associate the wonderful way they felt around him with the man himself. ([Location 2011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2011))
- The next time you’re given a compliment, the following steps will help you skillfully handle the moment: Stop. Absorb the compliment. Enjoy it if you can. Let that second of absorption show on your face. Show the person that they’ve had an impact. Thank them. Saying “Thank you very much” is enough, but you can take it a step further by thanking them for their thoughtfulness or telling them that they’ve made your day. ([Location 2036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2036))
- Stop. Absorb the compliment. Enjoy it if you can. Let that second of absorption show on your face. Show the person that they’ve had an impact. Thank them. Saying “Thank you very much” is enough, but you can take it a step further by thanking them for their thoughtfulness or telling them that they’ve made your day. ([Location 2037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2037))
- Don’t try to impress people. Let them impress you, and they will love you for it. Believe it or not, you don’t need to sound smart. You just need to make them feel smart. ([Location 2057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2057))
- When you speak in words, the brain has to relate the words to concepts, then translate the concepts into images, which is what actually gets understood. Why not speak directly in the brain’s own language? Whenever you can, choose to speak in pictures. You’ll have a much greater impact, and your message will be far more memorable. ([Location 2065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2065))
- Whenever you can, choose to speak in pictures. You’ll have a much greater impact, and your message will be far more memorable. ([Location 2066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2066))
- When you craft your images and metaphors, try to make them sensory-rich: involve as many of the five senses as possible. Believe it or not, you can do this in almost any situation, even with the driest of subjects. ([Location 2077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2077))
- When you speak or write, use few words and lots of pictures, and strive to make your communications useful, enjoyable, and even entertaining. ([Location 2106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2106))
- Putting It into Practice: Voice Fluctuation You can gain great insights into your own voice fluctuation by practicing sentences with a tape recorder. Repeat a sentence several times with as wide a variation in emotions as you can. Try to say it with authority, with anger, with sorrow, with empathetic care and concern, with warmth, and with enthusiasm. ([Location 2126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2126))
- Pitch and tone: The lower, more resonant, and more baritone your voice, the more impact it will have. Volume: One of the first things an actor learns to do on stage is to project his voice, which means gaining the ability to modulate its volume and aim it in such a targeted way that specific portions of the audience can hear it, even from afar. One classic exercise to hone your projection skills is to imagine that your words are arrows. As you speak, aim them at different groups of listeners. Tempo: A slow, measured tempo with frequent pauses conveys confidence. ([Location 2131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2131))
- The guidelines below will help you broadcast power through your voice. Speak slowly. Visualize the contrast between a nervous, squeaky teenager speaking at high speed and the slow, emphatic tone of a judge delivering a verdict. Pause. People who broadcast confidence often pause while speaking. They will pause for a second or two between sentences or even in the middle of a sentence. This conveys the feeling that they’re so confident in their power, they trust that people won’t interrupt. Drop intonation. You know how a voice rises at the end of a question? Just reread the last sentence and hear your voice go up at the end. Now imagine an assertion: a judge saying “This case is closed.” Feel how the intonation of the word closed drops. Lowering the intonation of your voice at the end of a sentence broadcasts power. When you want to sound superconfident, you can even lower your intonation midsentence. Check your breathing. Make sure you’re breathing deeply into your belly and inhale and exhale through your nose rather than your mouth. Breathing through your mouth can make you sound breathless and anxious. ([Location 2136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2136))
- There’s only one thing you need to do in order to project more warmth in your voice: smile. ([Location 2146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2146))
- “Logic makes people think. Emotion makes them act.” ([Location 2181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2181))
- Emotional contagion can of course have a corresponding negative effect, and it’s worth increasing your awareness of your own internal states, as well as your skill in handling your emotions, in order to manage the consequences of this propagation. ([Location 2211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2211))
- try to mirror the other person’s overall posture: the way they hold their head, how they place their feet, the shifts in their weight. If they move their left hand, move your right hand. Aim also to adapt your voice to theirs in speed, pitch, and intonation. ([Location 2232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2232))
- Good eye contact is incredibly important. Profound eye contact can have a powerful impact on people; it can communicate empathy and give an impression of thoughtfulness, wisdom, and intelligence. You simply cannot be charismatic without it. In fact, eye contact is one of the main ways charismatic masters make you feel that you are the most important person in the room. ([Location 2324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2324))
- One good way to avoid creating this anxiety is to keep eye contact for three full seconds at the end of your interaction with someone. This may sound short, but it’ll actually feel endless! If you can get into the habit of doing this, you’ll find it well worth the effort. With just a few seconds’ investment, people will feel you have truly paid attention to them. ([Location 2337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2337))

- As you look into someone’s eyes, pay attention to the physical sensations you are feeling in that very moment. ([Location 2342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2342))
- Charismatic eye contact means switching to a softer focus. This immediately relaxes our eyes and face, and quiets down our stress system. Here are three simple steps to help you switch to a soft, open focus: First, close your eyes. Focus on the space around you, the empty space in the room. Now focus on the space filling the entire universe. That’s it—you’ve moved into “soft focus.” ([Location 2353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2353))
- Putting It into Practice: Charismatic Eyes To truly understand how different your face appears when your eyes are relaxed and open, go see the transformation for yourself. ♦ Find a room with a mirror where you won’t be disturbed for a few minutes. ♦ Close your eyes and think of a recent annoyance—some minor issue that’s been bugging you lately, or an unpleasant task such as doing your taxes. ♦ When you feel the irritation take hold, open your eyes and look closely in the mirror. Note the tension around your eyes, their narrowness. ♦ Now close your eyes and think of something that would induce warm feelings—a recent pleasant experience, like time spent with a good friend. ♦ When the warmth has arisen, open your eyes and look at that precise kind of relaxation. That’s what warmth looks like. ♦ Close your eyes once more and think of an exciting time when you felt full of confidence and on top of the world—receiving a triumph, an award, some brilliant news. ♦ When you’ve accessed the feeling of confidence, open your eyes again and note closely what they look like now. That’s what confidence looks like. ([Location 2357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2357))
- Projecting power and confidence is what allows you to emanate warmth, enthusiasm, and excitement without coming across as overeager or subservient. ([Location 2378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2378))
- Take up as much space as you can. Inflate your chest and charge through the crowd. You might even swing your arms as you go, taking up yet more space. ([Location 2413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2413))
- Putting It into Practice: Being the Big Gorilla This is a great exercise to use before any meeting or interaction where you want to both feel and broadcast confidence—for instance, before a job interview, or before meeting someone who’s a bit intimidating. Follow these seven steps to convey confident body language:
  - Make sure you can breathe.
  - Loosen any clothing if need be.
  - Stand up and shake up your body.
  - Take a wide stance and plant your feet firmly on the ground. A wide, stable stance helps you both feel and project more confidence.
  - Stretch your arms to the ceiling, trying to touch it with your fingertips. Now stretch your arms to the walls on either side of you, trying to touch them.
  - Bring your arms loosely to your sides, and roll your shoulders up and then back.
  - INFLATE. Try to take up as much space as possible. Imagine puffing up like a gorilla, doubling in size. ([Location 2422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2422))
- your feet firmly on the ground. A wide, stable stance helps you both feel and project more confidence. Stretch your arms to the ceiling, trying to touch it with your fingertips. Now stretch your arms to the walls on either side of you, trying to touch them. Bring your arms loosely to your sides, and roll your shoulders up and then back. INFLATE. Try to take up as much space as possible. Imagine puffing up like a gorilla, doubling in size. As Stanford’s Gruenfeld found, people who assume expansive poses (taking up more space) experience a measurable physiological shift. In one experiment, assertivenessand energy-promoting hormones rose by 19 percent, while anxiety hormones fell by 25 percent. Assuming a strong, confident physical posture will make you feel more confident and more powerful. As you feel more powerful, your body language adapts accordingly. This in turn gives you yet another biochemical boost, and the cycle builds upon itself. All you have to do is get the cycle going, and if you keep practicing, confident body language will become second nature. ([Location 2426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2426))
- This kind of high-status, high-confidence body language is characterized by how few movements are made. Composed people exhibit a level of stillness, which is sometimes described as poise. They avoid extraneous, superfluous gestures such as fidgeting with their clothes, their hair, or their faces, incessantly nodding their heads, or saying “um” before sentences. ([Location 2438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2438))

	 - Note: Workable Action
- These gestures, which behavior experts identify as low-status, are often signs used by someone wanting to convey reassurance to the person they’re interacting with. The desire to convey reassurance can stem from two different sources: Empathy: wanting to ensure that the other person feels heard and understood and knows you’re paying attention Insecurity: wanting to please or appease the person you’re interacting with In contrast, people who come across as powerful, confident, or high-status are usually more contained; they don’t feel the urge to give so much reassurance because they’re not as worried about what their counterpart is thinking. ([Location 2440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2440))
- Fidgeting decreases presence, thus charisma. Even when you have warmth, confidence, and are mentally present, if you are physically restless, you can’t be charismatic. ([Location 2452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2452))
- Catch yourself when you find yourself nodding or verbally reassuring, and try to replace it with stillness and silence. Aim to get comfortable with silence, inserting pauses between your sentences or even midsentence. ([Location 2466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2466))
- One very effective trick is to carry around a stack of one-dollar bills and commit to ripping one up every time you trip. ([Location 2468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2468))
- To communicate warmth, aim to make people feel comfortable: respect their personal space, mirror their body language, and keep your eyes relaxed. ([Location 2493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2493))
- To project power, take up space (be the big gorilla) and be still (adopt a regal posture). Cut out verbal and nonverbal reassurances like head bobbing and excessive uh-huh-ing. ([Location 2497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2497))
- in general, when you have a group of difficult people to convince, you’ll have much greater chances of success if you work on each of them individually. ([Location 2519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2519))
- This technique has become known as the Ben Franklin Effect. Having lent Franklin the book, the opponent had to either consider himself as inconsistent (having done a favor for someone he disliked) or rationalize his action by deciding that he actually rather liked Franklin. ([Location 2540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2540))
- The most effective and credible compliments are those that are both personal and specific. For instance, instead of “Great job,” you could say, “You did a great job,” ([Location 2557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2557))
- When you show people how they’ve impacted you, they feel that they’ve in a sense made you. This sense of ownership gives them a vested interest, and they identify with you; you become part of their identity. Therefore, they feel more responsibility for ensuring your success. ([Location 2561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2561))
- “Getting angry is like taking a small dose of slow-acting poison,” he concluded. It leads to higher blood pressure and arterial damage, and it spurs cholesterol-filled fat cells to empty into the bloodstream. In brief, hostile feelings are apt to harm your health unless you know how to handle them. ([Location 2584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2584))
- Forgiving yourself and getting into a good mental state also helps you avoid appearing overly apologetic, subservient, or insecure. With the confidence that accompanies a positive internal state you can embody both warmth and contrition, yet still be seen as coming from a place of strength. ([Location 2756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2756))

- says that he often closes his eyes when listening. ([Location 2811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2811))
	 - Note: Great way for listening during phone conversations
- Just as actors do when they lend their voices to puppets, use the same body language techniques as you would in person. As actors know, this will greatly enhance your voice. Remember the smile studies that showed that listeners could identify sixteen different types of smiles based on sound alone. ([Location 2813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2813))
- Do not answer the phone in a warm or friendly manner. Instead, answer crisply and professionally. Then, only after you hear who is calling, let warmth or even enthusiasm pour forth in your voice. ([Location 2819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2819))
- To paraphrase Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, author of The Little Prince: perfection is not when there is no more to add, but when there is no more to subtract. ([Location 2832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2832))

- Using metaphors and analogies can be a highly effective way of capturing your audience’s imagination. ([Location 2877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2877))
- Make even numbers and statistics personal, meaningful, and relatable for your audience. ([Location 2881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2881))
- Charisma takes practice. Steve Jobs, who appeared so masterful on stage, was known to rehearse important presentations relentlessly. Just as a duck appears to be sailing smoothly on the surface of a lake while powerfully paddling below the waterline, it takes a whole lot of effort for a presentation to appear effortless. ([Location 2917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2917))
- owning the stage, and there are three tricks to making it happen. First, when you stand, be sure to have a wide stance, well balanced on both feet. ... Second, practice without a podium or a lectern. Speaking behind one can give the impression that you’re fearful to venture out, and prefer staying behind the safety of a shield. ... Third, find the right volume to project confidence. ([Location 2938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2938))
- First, when you stand, be sure to have a wide stance, well balanced on both feet. ([Location 2939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2939))
- make your audience feel particularly special, speak as if you were sharing a secret. Another way to make people feel special as you roam about the stage is to give one to two seconds of eye contact per person. ([Location 2953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2953))
- David also focused on increasing his voice fluctuation to enhance persuasiveness, on smiling when he wanted a warm voice, and on dropping the intonation of his voice when he wanted to convey confidence and authority. ([Location 2961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2961))
- Throughout your speech, pause frequently, deliberately. Have the confidence to make your listeners wait for your words. It’s called a dramatic pause for a reason: it adds drama. ([Location 2984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2984))
- Pausing is important both to begin and to end your speeches. When you walk on stage, come to the center, face the audience, and stop. Remain completely silent as you count three full seconds while slowly sweeping your eyes across the crowd ([Location 2987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2987))
- Pausing is equally critical to end your presentations. Don’t run off stage. ([Location 2989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2989))
- If you’re having trouble pausing, try color-coding your speeches. I used this technique for years when I first started out. I would use one blue bar for a one-beat pause, two red bars for a two-beat pause ([Location 2993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=2993))
- voice fluctuation, strategic pauses, and intonation drops to make your message compelling. ([Location 3001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=3001))
- If, instead, you can make it all about your audience—wondering how they’re doing—you take the focus off yourself, lift your self-consciousness, and get into a state of goodwill, which will be read and appreciated by the audience. ([Location 3034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=3034))

- Most charismatic leaders are known for their ability to remain (or appear) calm even in the midst of turbulent circumstances. As you know, anxiety impacts how you feel, how you perform, and how others perceive you and react to you. ([Location 3071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSZZ24&location=3071))
