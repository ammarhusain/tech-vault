## Highlights
- It doesn't matter how good your engineering team is if they are not given something worthwhile to build. ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=616))
- at least half of our ideas are just not going to work. There are many reasons for an idea to not work out. The most common is that customers just aren't as excited about this idea as we are. So, they choose not to use it. Sometimes they want to use it and they try it out, but the product is so complicated that it's simply more trouble than it's worth, so users again choose not to use it. ([Location 845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=845))
- We say if you're just using your engineers to code, you're only getting about half their value. The little secret in product is that engineers are typically the best single source of innovation; ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=865))
- projects are output and product is all about outcome. ([Location 872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=872))

- John Doerr, the famous Silicon Valley venture capitalist: “We need teams of missionaries, not teams of mercenaries.” Mercenaries build whatever they're told to build. Missionaries are true believers in the vision and are committed to solving problems for their customers. ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1063))

- There is a practical upper bound on a team, which usually works out to be around 8–12 engineers. You've probably heard about the two‐pizza rule, which is intended to help keep teams in this range. ([Location 1087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1087))
- these are the four critical contributions you need to bring to your team: deep knowledge (1) of your customer, (2) of the data, (3) of your business and its stakeholders, and (4) of your market and industry.

- The successful product manager must be the very best versions of smart, creative, and persistent. By smart, I don't just mean raw IQ. I especially mean intellectually curious, quickly learning and applying new technologies to solve problems for customers, to reach new audiences, or to enable new business models. By creative, I mean thinking outside the normal product box of features to solve business problems. By persistent, I mean pushing companies way beyond their comfort zone with compelling evidence, constant communication, and building bridges across functions in the face of stubborn resistance. ([Location 1311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=1311))
- The goal is that over time, the organization moves its focus from specific features launching on specific dates to business results. ([Location 4742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4742))
- The product manager has the responsibility to understand the considerations and constraints of the various stakeholders, and to bring this knowledge into the product team. ([Location 4806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4806))
- This is one of the keys of product discovery. In discovery, you are not only making sure that your solutions are valuable and usable (with customers), and feasible (with engineers), but you are also making sure your stakeholders will support the proposed solution. ([Location 4830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4830))
- Ben Horowitz's classic post “Good Product Manager/Bad Product Manager,” ([Location 4983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4983))
- Good teams have product, design, and engineering sit side by side, and they embrace the give and take between the functionality, the user experience, and the enabling technology. Bad teams sit in their respective silos, and ask that others make requests for their services in the form of documents and scheduling meetings. ([Location 4996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=4996))
- Good teams obsess over their reference customers. Bad teams obsess over their competitors. Good teams celebrate when they achieve a significant impact to the business results. Bad teams celebrate when they finally release something. ([Location 5015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=5015))
- The product strategy needs to spell out a logical and intentional sequence of target markets for the product teams to focus on. ([Location 5042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=5042))
- it's very possible that your product teams are entirely consumed just doing what we call keep the lights on activities. Fixing bugs, implementing capabilities for different parts of the business, addressing technical debt, and more. If this is your situation, you shouldn't be surprised at the lack of innovation. ([Location 5060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=5060))
- Technical debt. Often, the architecture does not facilitate or enable the rapid evolution of the product. ([Location 5071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=5071))
- The lack of a strong and capable product manager is typically a major reason for slow product. The impact of a weak product manager shows up in many ways, but it shows up very visibly as a team of mercenaries rather than missionaries. The product manager has not inspired or evangelized to the team, ([Location 5074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=5074))
- Not including engineers early enough during product discovery. The engineers need to participate in product discovery from the start of ideation. They will often contribute alternative approaches that can be significantly faster to implement if you include them early enough in the process ([Location 5089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=5089))
- What we're really talking about in this book is product culture. I've described to you how great product companies think, organize, and operate. ([Location 5113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NRB36N&location=5113))
