## Highlights
- At some point people are told entrepreneurship is a huge risk, and you believed it. You figured more preparation, more planning, and more talking to friends would help you overcome your insecurities. But that inaction only breeds more doubt and fear. In actuality, the best way to learn what we need to know—and become who we want to be—is by just getting started.

- Once you reframe rejection as something desirable, the act of asking becomes a power all its own. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C3ZH8FY5&location=148))

- Most people never pick up the phone, most people never ask. And that’s what separates, sometimes, the people that do things from the people that just dream about them. You gotta act. And you gotta be willing to fail. —Steve Jobs ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C3ZH8FY5&location=176))
- People do all kinds of scary things in the name of fun. Entrepreneurship is no exception. Make it fun and you’ll overcome the fear. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C3ZH8FY5&location=183))
- Don’t base your happiness or your self-worth on being the smartest, the most successful, the richest. Being so focused on the end results sets you up for a major fall because there’s ALWAYS going to be someone who’s smarter, more successful, or richer—and every time you see that you’ve fallen short, it will eat away at your motivation. Defining yourself by the things you do each day (the process) will get you to where you want to be quicker and more joyfully than measuring yourself against others.

- Most people: Overthink first, act later. Every successful entrepreneur: Act first, figure it out later. ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C3ZH8FY5&location=390))
- Don’t be afraid to act. Be afraid of living a life that seems more like a résumé than an adventure. And I promise, starting new things and following your fear makes life seem magical. You thought this was just about building a big beautiful business? Sure, it’s about that, too, but it’s also about using entrepreneurship as a way to renew and reinvent your life.

- The thing is, most people don’t ask for what they want. They wish for it, they make “suggestions” and drop hints, they hope. But the simple fact of business is that only by asking do you receive what you want. No ASK? No GET. That applies to every part of life. Seriously, every part. ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C3ZH8FY5&location=502))
- Persistence will reveal that most noes are actually a “not now.” ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C3ZH8FY5&location=560))
- It is deadly to build a business without first verifying that there are paying customers. ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C3ZH8FY5&location=691))
- Look for something working in one category and bring it to another. ([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C3ZH8FY5&location=729))
