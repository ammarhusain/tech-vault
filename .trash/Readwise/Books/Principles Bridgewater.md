## Highlights
- Be a 'hyperrealist'. Idealists who are not well grounded in reality create problems, not progress.
- Truth - more precisely, an accurate understanding of reality is the essential foundation for producing good outcomes.
- The thing we are striving for are just the baits to get us to chase after them in order to make us evolve, and it is the evolution and not the reward itself that matters to us and those around us. Our lives are not satisfied by obtaining our goals, but rather by striving for them.
- How much money people have earned is a rough measure of how much they gave society what it wanted. Not how much they desired.

- Typically defensive, emotional reactions, i.e. ego barriers - stand in the way of this progress.
- The quality of our lives depends on the quality of decisions we make.
- People need meaningful work & meaningful relationships in order to be fulfilled.
- Pain + Reflection = Progress.
- If you can reflect deeply about your problems they almost always shrink or disappear, because you find a better way of dealing with them than if you don't face them head on. The more difficult the problem, the more important to think by facing reality especially problems, mistakes and weaknesses. Deal with it!

- You don't have to know everything to get what you want. You just have to be honest with yourself and know who to ask for help.
- People who worry about looking good typically hide what they dont know and hide their weaknesses, so they never learn how to deal with it.
- Character is the ability to get oneself to do the difficult things that produce the desired results. The more you operate in the 'stretch zone', the more you adapt and the less character it takes to operate at the higher level of performance.
- Your most important role is to step back & design, operate and improve your 'machine' to get what you want. If you find that you cant do something well, fire yourself and get a good replacement.
- Biggest mistake most people make is to not see themselves and others objectively.
- 5 step process to get what you want:
  1. Have clear goals
  2. Identify and don't tolerate problems that stand in your way
  3. Accurately diagnose these problems
  4. Design plans that explicitly lay out tasks to get around problems and on to your goals
  5. Implement & execute on the plan.

- In order to stay centered and effective rather than stressed and thrown off by emotion: treat your life like a game. Your mission is to figure out how to get around challenges to your goals.

- By and large life will give you what you deserve and it doesn't give a damn what you like.
- When you think that its too hard, remember that in the long run, doing the things that will make you successful is a lot easier than being unsuccessful.
- You can have virtually anything you want, but you cannot have everything you want.
	- Note: life is like a giant smorgasbord of more delicious alternatives than you can ever hope
		to taste. So you have to reject having some things you want in order to get other things you want more.
		Some people fail at this point, afraid to reject a good alternative for fear that the loss will deprive them of some
		essential ingredient to their personal happiness. As a result, they pursue too many goals at the same time,
		achieving few or none of them.
- Take the attitude of:
  - total flexibility - good answers can come from anyone or anywhere,
  - total accountability - regardless of where the good answers come from, its your job to find them.
- Achieving your goals isn't just about moving forward, inevitably you must deal with setbacks.
- It is essential to bring problems to the surface. Thinking about difficult problems can produce anxiety that stands in the way of progress. Push through the pain of facing your problems, knowing you will end up in a much better place.
- Remember that identifying problems is like finding gems embedded in puzzles; if you solve the puzzles you will get the gems that will make your life much better.

- Be very precise in specifying your problems. Once you identify them, you must not tolerate them.
- If you are motivated, you can succeed even if you do not have the abilities (talents and skills).
- Diagnosing problems:
  - Be calm & logical,
  - Get at the root causes (not proximate causes)
- What differentiates people who live up to their potential from those who don't is a willingness to look at themselves and others objectively. You must be willing to look at your own behavior and the behavior of others as possible causes of problems.
- Exercise becomes pleasurable for people who hardwire the connection between exercise and its benefits.
- The list of tasks falls out from a story. A story (or plan) is what connects your goals to the tasks. For you to succeed you must not lose sight of the goals or their story while focusing on the tasks. Have an ability to visualize and a practical understanding of how things really work.
- Designing precedes doing: The design will give you your to-do list.
- The importance of good work habits is vastly underrated. It is critical to know each day what you need to do and have the discipline to do it. People with good work habits have to-do lists that are reasonably prioritized, and they make themselves do what needs to be done. People with poor habits almost always randomly react to stuff that comes at them.
- You always need to know whether you are following the plan, so you should establish clear benchmarks.
- Results oriented: if you see daily tasks are taking them away from executing the plan, then diagnose it and design how you can deal with both the daily tasks and moving forward with the plan.
- The only purpose of tasks is to achieve goals. Your goals must be riveted in your mind. To remember the connections between the tasks and the goals that you are meant to achieve, you just have to ask 'Why?'

- Weakness: Ask yourself 'what you want', then ask 'what is true' and then ask yourself 'what should be done about it'.
- Being weak is not a problem if you understand what you are weak at and successfully compensate for that weakness by seeking help.
- Life is like a game where you seek to overcome the obstacles that stand in the way of you achieving your goals. You get better at this game through practice. The game consists of a series of choices that have consequences
- You cannot stop the choices or problems from coming at you, so its better to learn how to deal with them
- You have the freedom to make whatever choices you want, though it's best to be mindful of their consequences
- The pain of a problem is a call to find solutions. Its silly, pointless & harmful to be upset at the problems and choices that come at you
- We all evolve at different paces. This process goes better if you are as accurate as possible; in all respects - strengths & weaknesses
- Work for what you want and not for what others want of you
- Come up with the best independent opinions you can muster to move towards your goals
- Stress test your opinions by having the smartest people you can find to challenge you
- Be wary about overconfidence, and be good at not knowing
- Wrestle with reality; experience the results of your decisions and reflect on what you did to produce them so that you can improve.

	 - Tags: #readwise/favorite
- Be assertive and open minded at the same time
  - Have nothing to do with closed minded, inexperienced people
  - Be wary of the arrogant intellectual who comments from the stands without having played on the field
  - Watch out for people who think its embarrassing not to know
- Know when to stop debating and move on to agreeing about what should be done
  - Recognize that there are 'many good ways to skin a cat'
  - Distinguish between idle complaints and complaints that are meant to lead to improvement
  - Lead the discussion by being assertive and open minded
  - Watch out for 'topic slip'
- Everything good comes from having great people operating in a great culture
  - Choose those who understand the difference between goals and tasks
  - People who see things & think one way have difficulty communicating and relating to people who see & think another way.
- Understand the difference between managing, micro-managing and not managing
- Dont try to be followed; try to be understood and to understand others. Dont try to control by giving orders. Communicate the logic and welcome feedback.
- Dont worry if your people like you; worry about whether you are helping your people to be great
- Know what you want and stick to it if you believe its right, even if others want to take you another way
- Watch out for the unfocused and unproductive 'we should (do something)'. Avoid the theoretical 'should'
- Provide constant, clear & honest feedback, and encourage discussion of this feedback
  - Put your compliments & criticisms into perspective. Encourage objective reflection.
- Look at patterns of behaviors and don't read too much into any one event. Don't believe that being good or bad at somethings means that the person is good or bad at everything.
- Experience creates internalization.
- Train people, don't rehabilitate them
- Recognize that all problems are just manifestations of their root causes, so diagnose to understand what the problems are symptomatic of.
- Put things in perspective: beware of paying too much attention to what is coming at you and not enough attention to what your responsibilities are or how your machine should work to achieve your goals
- There is no sense in having laws unless you have policemen (auditors).
- Recognize the 'Power of Knowing' and how to deal with 'Not Knowing'
- Understand that the ability to deal with not knowing is far more powerful than knowing. 'What don't I know and what should I do about it?'
  - Finding the path to success is at least as dependent on coming up with the right questions as coming up with answers.
  - Remember that your goal is to find the best answer, not to give the best one you have.
  - Successful people ask for criticism from others and consider its merit.
- Don't be a perfectionist: 80% of the juice can be gotten with 20% of squeezing. Watch out for 'detail anxiety'. There are relatively few ( < 5) important things to consider in making a decision.
- Watch out for unproductively identifying possibilities without assigning probabilities, because it screws up prioritization.
- Don't try to please everyone
- Being truthful is an extension of your freedom to be you; people who are one way on the inside & another on the outside become conflicted and often lose touch with their own values.
- **Thomas Edison**: 'I have not failed, I've just found 10000 ways that don't work. Many of life's failures are men who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up'.
- The most valuable comments are accurate criticisms. Write down your weaknesses
- You can convert the pain of seeing your mistakes and weaknesses into pleasure. Pains that come from seeing mistakes and weaknesses are 'growing pains' that you learn from. If you recognize short term failure as a step toward long term success, you wont be afraid of it or made uncomfortable by it and you will approach all your experiences as learning experiences, even the most difficult ones.

- Self reflective people openly and objectively look at themselves while deflective people do not.
- People who suppress the mini confrontation for fear of conflict tend to have huge conflicts later. People who address the mini conflicts head on in order to straighten things out tend to have the great, long lasting relationships. People should feel free to say whatever they really think.
- It's important to do big things well than to do small things perfectly.

- There is an over-abundance of confident bad opinions around and very few thoughtful conclusions arising from learning from each other. It is common for conversations to start with 'I think ... ' followed by their conclusions, and both parties believing they had a good conversation even though nothing was accomplished. If most people did the opposite, ie sought out and open-mindedly explored their disagreements - it would produce a radical increase in learning.
- It is not possible for everyone to debate everything all the time and still get work done effectively.
- If it is your meeting to run, manage the conversation.
- If you are calm and analytical in listening to others' points of view, it is more difficult for them to shut down a logical exchange than if you get emotional or allow them to get emotional.
- Conversations often fail to reach completion. When there is an exchange of ideas, especially if there is a disagreement, it is important to end it by stating the conclusions. If there is agreement; say it, if not, say that. Where further action has been decided, get those tasks on a to-do list, assign people to do them & specify due dates. Discussion does not mean rule by referendum.
- If you see conversations derail, could say: 'Lets not get hyperbolic', 'Lets avoid hyperbole if you will, I see what you're saying'.
- Perceivers see things happening and work backward to understand the cause and how to respond; they work from the outside in; they also see many more possibilities that they compare and choose from; often they see so many that they are confused by them. In contrast planners work from the inside out, figuring out first what they want to achieve and then how things should unfold. Planners & perceivers have trouble appreciating each other. While a perceiver likes to see new things and change directions often, this is discomforting to planners who prefer to stick to a plan. Planners are typically left-brained, and perceivers are typically right-brained.
- Different ways of seeing and thinking make people suitable for different jobs
- Hire right, because the penalties of hiring wrong are huge.
- Constantly compare your outcomes to your goals.
- Clearly assign responsibilities; eliminate any confusion about expectations
- People who see the tasks & lose sight of the goals will just explain the tasks that were done and not make the connection to how those tasks relate to the machine that produces outcomes & achieves goals.
- Character is the ability to get yourself to do the difficult but right things.
- Communicate the plan clearly.
- Learn confidence in your people - don't presume it. New people shouldn't be offended if we haven't yet formed that confidence.
- The boss should avoid being drawn into doing the job of the person who is failing without exploring why the job has not been done successfully without help.
- It is much easier for people to remain spectators offering unchallenged comments from the stands than to become players on the field.
- If problems take you by surprise, it is probably because you are either too far removed from your people and processes or you haven't adequately thought through how the people and processes might lead to various outcomes.
- Be very specific about problems.
- The real sign of a master manager is that he doesn't have to 'do' practically anything. Managers should view the need to get involved in the nitty-gritty themselves as a bad sign.
- It is far better to find a few smart people and give them the best technology than to have more ordinary less well equipped people.
- Fight for what you believe is best by being open minded and assertive at the same time.
- Goal is to come up with the best answer, the probability of your having it is small, and that even if you have it you can't be confident that you do have it unless you have other believable people test you.
- Don't mistake small things for unimportant things, because some small things can be very important, such as giving a hug or a gift.
- Understand the concept and use the phrase 'by and large'. Discussions fail to progress when some statement leads to a discussions of the exceptions rather than the rule.
- Not everyone is going to be happy about every decision you make, especially the decision that says they can't do something.
