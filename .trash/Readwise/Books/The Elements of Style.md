## Highlights
- The Elements of Style, when I reexamined it in 1957, seemed to me to contain rich deposits of gold. It was Will Strunk’s parvum opus, his attempt to cut the vast tangle of English rhetoric down to size and write its rules and principles on the head of a pin.

- Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all sentences short or avoid all detail and treat subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.

- 2. In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last. ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NPN5HTP&location=200))
- 3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas. ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NPN5HTP&location=209))
- Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NPN5HTP&location=262))
- The early records of the city have disappeared, and the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NPN5HTP&location=263))
- Do not join independent clauses with a comma.       If two or more clauses grammatically complete and not joined by a conjunction are to form a single compound sentence, the proper mark of punctuation is a semicolon. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NPN5HTP&location=275))
- Note that if the second clause is preceded by an adverb, such as accordingly, besides, then, therefore, or thus, and not by a conjunction, the semicolon is still required.   I had never been in the place before; besides, it was dark as a tomb. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NPN5HTP&location=290))
- Do not break sentences in two. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NPN5HTP&location=299))
- I met them on a Cunard liner many years ago. Coming home from Liverpool to New York. She was an interesting talker. A woman who had traveled all over the world and lived in half a dozen countries.   In both these examples, the first period should be replaced by a comma ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NPN5HTP&location=302))
- 7. Use a colon after an independent clause to introduce a list of particulars, an appositive, an amplification, or an illustrative quotation. ([Location 312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NPN5HTP&location=312))
- 8. Use a dash to set off an abrupt break or interruption and to announce a long appositive or summary. ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NPN5HTP&location=333))
- 9. The number of the subject determines the number of the verb.       Words that intervene between subject and verb do not affect the number of the verb.   The bittersweet flavor of youth — its trials, its joys, its adventures, its challenges — are not soon forgotten. »»»»» The bittersweet flavor of youth — its trials, its joys, its adventures, its challenges — is not soon forgotten.

- Use a singular verb form after each, either, everyone, everybody, neither, nobody, someone.   Everybody thinks he has a unique sense of humor. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NPN5HTP&location=354))
- A singular subject remains singular even if other nouns are connected to it by with, as well as, in addition to, except, together with, and no less than.   His speech as well as his manner is objectionable. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NPN5HTP&location=370))
- The shape of our language is not rigid; in questions of usage we have no lawgiver ([Location 841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NPN5HTP&location=841))
