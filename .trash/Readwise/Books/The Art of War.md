## Highlights
- The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, ... These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and discipline. ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=634))
- 17. All warfare is based on deception.
  18. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near. ([Location 656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=656))

- If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=661))

- There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare. ([Location 678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=678))
- In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns. ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=695))
- to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting. ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=702))
- five essentials for victory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. (2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. (3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. (5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign. ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=725))
- If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle. ([Location 731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=731))
- To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself. ([Location 736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=736))
- What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease. ([Location 747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=747))
- Sun Tzu said: The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers. ([Location 762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=762))

- In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory. ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=767))
- Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted. ([Location 796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=796))
- All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved. ([Location 836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=836))
- The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain. ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=850))
- Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:—this is the art of retaining self-possession. ([Location 883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=883))
- There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must be not attacked, towns which must not be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed. ([Location 897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=897))
- The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy’s not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable. ([Location 908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=908))
- There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction; (2) cowardice, which leads to capture; (3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; (4) a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; (5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble. ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=910))

- Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance. Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat. ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=951))
- When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are not clear and distinct; when there are no fixed duties assigned to officers and men, and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is utter DISORGANIZATION. ([Location 1006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=1006))
- Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death. If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose. ([Location 1018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=1018))
- Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know your design. When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy. ([Location 1110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=1110))
- If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are. Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content. But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life. ([Location 1148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QR86XF&location=1148))
