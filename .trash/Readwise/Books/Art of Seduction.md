## Highlights
### The Seductive Character
- **Rake**
  - Great female fantasy figure - when he desires a woman he will go to the ends of the earth for her.
  - He may be disloyal, dishonest & amoral, but that only adds to his appeal. Unrestrained.
  - Male is vulnerable to the visual while women's weaknesses are language and words.
- **Ideal Lover**
  - Reflects your fantasy. He/she is an artist in creating the illusion you require, idealizing your potrait.
  - Nothing is more seductive than patient attentiveness.
  - Most people believe themselves to be inwardly greater than they outwardly appear to the world. They are full of unrealizsed ideals.
  - Make them feel elevated, lofty spiritual and your power over them will be limitless.
- **Dandy**
  - Be both masculine & feminine; impudent & charming; subtle & outrageous.
  - Androgynous (partly male & female). Dressing & appearance while not flashy are eye catching.
- **Natural**
  - Adopt the pose of the Natural to neutralize people's natural defensiveness and infect them with helpless delight.
  - We harbor an illusion of childhood as a kind of golden age, even though it can often be a period of great confusion & pain.
  - Whenever they are dissatified with their present surroundings, they turn back to the past and hope that they will now be able to prove the truth of the inextinguishable dream of a golden age.
  - If your skill takes practice, you must hide this and learn to make your work appear effortless.
  - Innocent; devilish; undefensive
- **Coquette**
  - Too much attention can be interesting for a while, but it soon grows cloying and finally becomes claustrophobic & frightening.
  - The less you seem to need other people, the more likely others will be drawn to you.
  - Project self-sufficiency and with such detachment you will be able to play people's emotions like a piano.
  - Aloof; independent
- **Charmer**
  - Do not argue or fight; complain or pester - aim at people's primary weaknesses: vanity & self-esteem.
  - Being light-hearted & fun is always more charming than being serious and critical.
  - Never whine, never complain, never try to justify yourself.
  - Listen more; talk less
- **Charismatic**
  - Heighten their charisma with a piercing gaze, fiery oratory, an air of mystery.
  - Direction does not matter: pick a cause, an ideal, a vision and show that you will not sway from your goal.
  - Rely on the power of words; words are the quickest way to create emotional disturbance.
  - Slow authoritative style is often more effective than passionate oratory.
  - Be the actor who stays calm, radiating self-assurance.
  - Be brazen and courageous in your actions- be seen taking risk for the good of others.
  - Demeanor may be poised & calm, but their eyes are magnetic; they have a piercing gaze that disturbs their targets emotions, exerting force without words or action. Eyes of the Charismatic never show fear or nerves.
  - Strong eye contact; purposeful and eloquent.
- **Star**
  - Learn to become an object of fascination by projecting the glittering but elusive presence.
  - Stand out from others through a distinctive and appealing style
  - Be vague and ethereal, keeping a distance to letting people imagine more than there is.
### The Seductive Process
- Seduction is a process that occurs over time - the longer you take and the slower your go, the deeper you will penetrate into the mind of your victim.
- **1. Choose the right victim**
  - Recognize them by the way they respond to you.
  - Pay greater attention to those responses outside conscious control - a blush, an involuntary mirroring of some gesture of yours, an unusual shyness, even perhaps a flash of anger or resentment.
  - Challenge is pleasure.
- **2. Create a False Sense of Security - Approach Indirectly**
  - Arrange a 'chance' encounter - nothing is more seductive than a sense of destiny.
- **3. Send mixed signals**
  - Be hard to figure out. A mix of qualities suggests depth, which fascinates even as it confuses.
  - If you have a sweet face and an innocent air, let out hints of something dark, even vaguely cruel in your character. It is not advertised in your words, but in your manner. Do not worry if this under-quality is a negative one; people will be drawn to the enigma - pure goodness is rarely seductive.
  - This strategy is only powerful if the under quality is merely hinted at; if the mix is too obvious or striking it will seem bizarre or even threatening.
- **4. Appear to be an object of desire - create triangles**
  - It will be greatly to your advantage to entertain the lady you would win with an account of the number of women who are in love with you, and of the decided advances which they have made to you.
  - When people's vanity is at risk, you can make them do whatever you want.
  - I don't want any of the good things in life, unless people are envious of them.
  - Do not let your targets see you so often; keep your distance, seem unattainable, out of their reach. An object that is rare and hard to obtain is generally more prized.
- **5. Create a need - stir anxiety and discontent**
  - Everyone lacks a sense of completeness, feels something missing deep inside. Bring their doubts and anxieties to the surface and they can be led and lured to follow you.
  - The desire to have someone fill up our emptiness is the weakness on which all seducers prey.
  - Create a wound in your victim, aiming at their soft spot, the chink in their self-esteem. If they are stuck in a rut, make them feel it more deeply, 'innocently' bringing it up and talking about it.
  - They must feel the wound before they fall in love.
  - Desire and love have for their object things or qualities which a man does not at present possess but which he lacks : Socrates
- **6. Master the art of insinuation**
  - The art of planting ideas in people's minds by dropping elusive hints that take root days later, even appearing to them as their own idea.
  - Insinuation is the supreme means of influencing people.
  - Create a sub-language - bold statements followed by retraction and apology, ambiguous comments, banal talk combined with alluring glances. Make everything suggestive.
  - Slip of the tongue, apparently inadvertent 'sleep on it' comments, alluring references, statements for which you quickly apologize - all of these have immense insinuating power.
  - While honesty and saying what you want may make you feel good, you are probably not getting anywhere.
- **7. Enter their spirit**
  - Play to their rules, enjoy what they enjoy, adapt yourself to their moods. Soon you can shift the dynamic; once you have entered their spirit you can make them enter yours, at a point when it is too late to turn back.
  - Paradoxically, the way to entice people out of their shell is to become more like them. You do not have to spend days studying their minds; simple conform to their moods, adapt to their tastes, play along with whatever they send your way.
  - The attention you pay to them is intoxicating - since you are mirroring them, everything they see and hear from you reflects their own ego and tastes. What a boost to their vanity.
- **8. Create temptation**
  - Find that weakness of theirs, that fantasy that has yet to be realized, and hint that you can lead them toward it.
  - As a seducer you can never mistake people's appearance for reality. You know that their fight to keep order in their lives is exhausting, and that they are gnawed by doubts and regrets.
  - Your task is to create temptation that is stronger than the daily variety. It has to be focused on them, aimed at them as individuals - at their weakness.
  - People are perversely excited by what they cannot or should not have.
  - You can always tempt them by seeming difficult, challenging, even a little cruel. Keep the connection vague.
- **9. Keep them in suspense - what comes next?**
  - The moment people feel they know what to expect from you, your spell on them is broken. Worse: you have ceded them power.
  - Doing something they do not expect from you will give them a delightful sense of spontaneity. You are always one step ahead and in control. Give them a thrill with a sudden change of direction.
- **10. Use the demonic power of words to sow confusion**
  - You have to stop saying the first thing that comes to your mind - you have to control the urge to prattle and vent your opinions. They key is to see words as a tool not for communicating true thoughts & feelings but for confusing, delighting, and intoxicating.
  - Learn to sniff out the parts of a person's ego that need validation and then aim your flattery directly at such insecurities.
  - There is a superior way to get people to listen and be persuaded: humor and a light touch.
  - Affirmative language is active language, full of verbs, imperatives and short sentences. Cut out 'I believe', 'Perhaps', 'In my opinion'. Head straight for the heart.
  - Design your letters as homages to your targets.
  - If you tell an anecdote, make it somehow relate to them.
- **11. Pay attention to detail**
  - Learn to distract your victims with a myriad of pleasant little rituals - thoughtful gifts tailored just for them, clothes and adornments designed to please them, gestures that show the time and attention you are paying them.
  - When your targets are with you, you must never give them the feeling they normally get in the real world. You need to deliberately slow things down, and return them to the simpler times of their youth.
  - A gift has immense seductive power, but the object itself is less important than the gesture. Perhaps the choice relates to something from the target's past, or symbolizes something between you, or merely represents the lengths you will go to please. Expensive gifts have no sentiments attached.
  - Never tell someone what you are feeling; let them guess it in your looks and gestures.
- **12. Poeticize your presence**
  - Occupy their minds by alternating an exciting presence with a cool distance, exuberant moments followed by calculated absences.
  - We all have a self-image that is more flattering than the truth: we think of ourselves as more generous, selfless, honest, kindly, intelligent, or good-looking than in fact we are.
  - The Halo separates you from other people. Do not make it disappear by becoming familiar and ordinary.
- **13. Disarm through strategic weakness and vulnerability**
  - You know a man ain't worth a damn if he cannot cry at the right time: LBJ
- **14. Confuse desire and reality - The Perfect Illusion**
  - Role playing is immensely pleasurable
  - Ascertain their unsatisfied desires, their wishes crying out for fulfillment. Perhaps they want to see themselves as noble or romantic, but life has thwarted them. Perhaps they want an adventure. If something seems to validate this wish, they become emotional and irrational, almost to the point of hallucination.
  - Few have the power to see through an illusion they desperately want to believe in.
- **15. Isolate the Victim**
  - The key to isolating your targets psychologically is to pay them intense attention, to make them feel that there is nothing else in the world but the two of you.
  - Put them in a spot where they have no place to go, and they will die before fleeing : Sun-Tzu
- **16. Prove Yourself**
  - Two ways to prove yourself:
  - First is spontaneous action: Impress the target by going further than really necessary - sacrificing more money, more time, more effort than they had expected.
  - Second is the brave deed that you plan & execute in advance, on your own and at the right moment. Cleverly lead your victim into a crisis, a moment of danger, or indirectly put them in an uncomfortable position, and you can play the rescuer, the gallant knight.
- **17. Effect a Regression**
  - People who have experienced a certain kind of pleasure in the past will try to repeat or relive it. The deepest-rooted and most pleasurable memories are usually those from earliest childhood, and are often unconsciously associated with a parental figure. Bring your targets back to that point by placing yourself in the oedipal triangle and positioning them as the needy child.
  - Alternatively you too can regress, letting them play the role of the protecting, nursing parent. In either case you are offering the ultimate fantasy: the chance to have an intimate relationship with mommy or daddy, son or daughter.
- **18. Stir up the Transgressive and Taboo**
  - People yearn to explore their dark side. Not everything in romantic love is supposed to be tender and soft; hint that you have a cruel, even sadistic streak. Once the desire to transgress draws your targets to you, it will be hard for them to stop.
- **19. Use Spiritual Lures**
  - Play up your divine qualities; affect an air of discontent with worldly things; speak of the stars, destiny, the hidden threads that unite you and the object of the seduction. Spiritual union of two souls.
  - People are dying to believe in something. Invite the other person to worship something: nature, a work of art, or an exotic religion, noble cause, a saint or a guru.
- **20. Mix Pleasure with Pain**
  - Instead of overwhelming your targets with niceness, try inflicting some pain. Lure them in with focused attention, then change direction, appearing suddenly uninterested.
  - You have more to fear by boring your targets than shaking them up.
  - Follow up pain with pleasure and you will create a state of dependency that will last for a long time.
  - Anxiety captivates the most. So also with love, if it is to be interesting. Behind it ought to brood the deep anxious night from which springs the flower of love : Soren Kierkegaard
  - Do not worry about making people angry; anger is a sure sign that you have your hooks in them. Nor should you be afraid that if you make yourself difficult people will flee - we only abandon those who bore us.
    - Note: There are a bunch of quotes from essays by Soeren Kierkegaard ... Was he really good at this?
- **21. Give them space to fall - The Pursuer is Pursued**
  - We learn to love only through rejection.
  - First shower your targets with affection. They will not be sure where this is coming from, but it is a delightful feeling, and they will never want to lose it. When it does go away, in your strategic step back, they will have moments of anxiety and anger, perhaps throwing a tantrum, and then the same childlike reaction.
- **22. Use Physical Lures**
  - Seduction, like warfare, is often a game of distance and closeness.
  - Exhibit a lightness of spirit - nothing bothers you, nothing daunts you, you take nothing personally.
  - Empty yourself of your tendency to moralize and judge.
- **23. Master the Art of the Bold Move**
  - Showing heistation or awkwardness means you are thinking of yourself, as opposed to being overwhelmed by the victim's charmss.
  - No one is born timid; timidity is a protection we develop.
  - Humility may have its social uses, but it is deadly in seduction.
  - If everyone were bold, boldness would quickly lose its allure.
- **24. Beware the Aftereffects**
  - Never let the other person take you for granted - use absence, create pain and conflict.
