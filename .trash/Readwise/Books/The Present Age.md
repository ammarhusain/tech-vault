## Highlights
- Criticism is a splendid thing as long as we are spared.
- A revolutionary age is the age of action; ours is the age of advertisement and publicity. Nothing ever happens but there is immediate publicity everywhere.
- The age of great and good actions is past, the present is the age of anticipation when even recognition is received in advance. No one is satisfied with doing something definite, every one wants to feel flattered by reflection with the illusion of having discovered at the very least a new continent.
    - Note: Reflection for Kierkegaard means people trying to form a mirage of a character than living up to that character itself
- Even at the height of the banquet, when the applause was loudest, the admiring guests would all have a shrewd notion that the action of the man who received all the honour was not really so extraordinary, and that only by chance was the gathering for him, since after all, with a little practice, everyone could have done as much.
- Most dangerous of all diseases - to admire in public what is considered unimportant in private - since everything is made into a joke.
- To be witty without possessing the riches of inwardness is like squandering money upon luxuries and dispensing with the necessities, or as the proverb says: selling one's breeches to buy a wig.
- One thing is certain, an increased power of reflection like an increased knowledge only adds to man's affliction.
- Just as air in a sealed space becomes poisonous, so the imprisonment of reflection develops a culpable ressentiment if it is not ventilated by action or incident of any kind.
- The ressentiment which results from want of character can never understand that eminent distinction really is distinction. Neither does it understand itself by recognizing distinction negatively (as in the case of ostracism) but wants to drag it down, wants to belittle it so that it really ceases to be distinguished. And ressentiment not only defends itself against all existing forms of distinction but against that which is still to come.
- For unless the individual learns in the reality of religion and before God to be content with himself, and learns, instead of dominating others, to dominate himself, content as priest to be his own audience, and as author his own reader, if he will not learn to be satisfied with that as the highest, because it is the expression of the equality of all men before God and of our likeness to others, then he will not escape from reflection.
- 'The public' is an abstraction, consisting of unreal individuals who never are and never can be united in an actual situation or organization - and yet are held together as a whole.
- Reflection is not the evil; but a reflective condition and the deadlock which it involves, by transforming the capacity for action into a means of escape from action, is both corrupt and dangerous.
- The creative omnipotence of the differentiating power of passion, which makes the individual completely at one with himself, is transformed into the extended scope of reflective understanding; as a result of knowing and being everything possible, one is in contradiction with oneself, i.e. nothing at all.
- Only some one who knows how to remain essentially silent can really talk - and act essentially. Silence is the essence of inwardness, of the inner life.
- The exteriorized caricature of inwardness is vulgarity and talkativeness.
- Every one knows a great deal, we all know which way we ought to go and all the different ways we can go, but nobody is willing to move.
- Now every one can have an opinion; but they have to band together numerically in order to have one.
- An individual is either lost in the dizziness of unending abstraction or saved for ever in the reality of religion.
