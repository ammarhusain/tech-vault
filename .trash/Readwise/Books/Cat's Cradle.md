## Highlights
- In the beginning, God created the earth, and he looked upon it in His cosmic loneliness.
  And God said, "Let Us make living creatures out of mud, so the mud can see what We have done.
  And God created every living creature that now moveth, and one was man. Mud as man alone could speak. God leaned close as mud as man sat up, looked around, and spoke. Man blinked. "What is the purpose of all this?" he asked politely.
  "Everything must have a purpose?" asked God.
  "Certainly," said man.
  "Then I leave it to you to think of one for all this," said God. And He went away. (Page 265)
- Of all the words of mice and men, the saddest are, "It might have been." (Page 279)
- "Beware of the man who works hard to learn something, learns it, and finds himself no wiser than before," Bokonon tells us. "He is full of murderous resentment of people who are ignorant without having come by their ignorance the hard way." (Page 281)
- If I were a younger man, I would write a history of human stupidity; and I would climb to the top of Mount McCabe and lie down on my back with my history for a pillow; and I would take from the ground some of the blue-white poison that makes statues of men; and I would make a statue of myself, lying on my back, grinning horribly, and thumbing my nose at You Know Who. (Page 287)
- People have to talk about something just to keep their voice boxes in working order, so they’ll have good voice boxes in case there’s ever anything really meaningful to say.
- “Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly;
  Man got to sit and wonder 'why, why, why?'
  Tiger got to sleep, bird got to land;
  Man got to tell himself he understand.”
