## Highlights
### Becoming the Boss
- From new managers you hear a tale of disorientation and overwhelming confusion. They don't realize how sharply management differs from individual work. Eg: subordinates don't necessarily obey your orders despite your formal authority over them, you wont have freedom to make things happen - instead you’ll be constrained by organizational interdependencies.You're responsible not only for maintaining your own operations but also for initiating positive changes both inside and outside of your areas of responsibility.
- Until they give up the myth of authority for the reality of negotiating interdependencies, new managers will not be able to lead effectively.
- They need to demonstrate their competence - knowing how to do the right thing. This can be problematic, because new managers initially feel the need to prove their technical knowledge & prowess, the foundations of their success as individual performers.
- You need to build your influence by creating a web of strong, interdependent relationships, based on credibility & trust, throughout your team & the entire organization.
- New managers tend to handle issues, even those with teamwide implications, one on one. This leads them to make decisions based on unnecessarily limited information.
- When new managers focus solely on 1-1 relationships, they neglect a fundamental aspect of effective leadership: harnessing the collective power of the group to improve individual performance & commitment.
- New managers need to generate changes, both within & outside their areas of responsibility, to ensure their teams’ success. They need to work to change the context in which their teams operate, ignoring their lack of formal authority.
- Find coaching & mentoring from peers outside your function/org.
### Leading the team you inherit
- Explicitly state your criteria: What qualities should people have in order to tackle the particular challenges your team faces?
- Ask people the same questions, & see how their insights vary. What are our biggest challenges & opportunities in the short term? If you were in my position, what would your priorities be?
- Building on their assessment & reshaping work, leaders need to energize team members with some early wins.
### Saving your Rookie Managers from themselves
- Basic skills that trip up most new managers: mastering delegation, thinking strategically & communicating.
- Trouble may be exacerbated by normal insecurities that make rookie managers hesitant to ask for help, even when they find themselves in thoroughly unfamiliar territory.
- Common fears: losing stature, abdicating control, afraid of overburdening his staff.
- They’re so focused on substance that they forget that form counts too. If they don't project confidence, they're unlikely to inspire & energize their teams.
- As a recent IC armed with plenty of technical know how, the rookie manager instinctively runs to the immediate rescue of any client or staff member in need.
- Straightforward performance issue evolves into a credibility problem. When the manager finally addresses the problem, she personalizes it, lets her frustration seep into the discussion with her staff member & finds the recipient rushing to defend himself. Most inexperienced managers wait far too long to talk with staff about performance problems.
- Recommending change in action is much easier than recommending a change in attitude. You can’t ask people to change their personalities, but you can ask them to change their behaviors.
- “Can you tell me more about what you mean by that?”. Simple technique bought her the time she needed to gather her thoughts & engage productively rather than defensively.
### Managing the High Intensity workplace
- Treating work as the be-all and end-all may be fulfilling when the job is going well, but it leads to fragility in the long term.
### Harnessing the Science of Persuasion
- Principles:
  - People are more likely to follow someone who is similar to them than who is not
  - Enlist peers to help make their case
  - People like those who like them.
  - Uncover real similarities & offer genuine praise.
  - People tend to treat you the way you treat them
  - Do a favor before seeking one
  - People are more likely to keep promises they make voluntarily & explicitly.
  - Get commitments in writing.
  - People defer to experts
  - Take pains to establish your own expertise & not assume its self evident.
  - People want more of a commodity when its scarce
  - Exclusive information is more persuasive than widely available data.
### What Makes a Leader
- Three categories of personal capabilities:
  - Purely technical skills: accounting, planning etc.
  - Cognitive abilities: Analytical reasoning
  - Emotional Intelligence: Ability to work with others & effectiveness in leading change
- Emotional Intelligence (EI) skills are most important among capabilities to enable the best leaders. EI skills are:
  - Self-awareness: Knowing one’s strengths, weaknesses, drives, values & impact on others.
  - Self-regulation: People who are in control of their feeling and impulses, i.e. people who are reasonable, are able to create an environment of trust & fairness.
  - Motivation: Those with leadership potential are motivated by a deeply embedded desire to achieve for the sake of achievement.
  - Empathy: Understanding other people’s emotional makeup
  - Social Skill: Building rapport with others to move them in desired directions.
### The Authenticity Paradox
- Inexperienced leaders, especially true-to-selfers, often find the process of getting buy-in distasteful because it feels artificial & political; they believe that their work should stand on its own merits.
- Many managers know deep down that their good ideas & strong potential will go unnoticed if they don’t do a better job of selling themselves. This hesitancy disappears as people gain experience & become more certain of the value they bring.
- Think of leadership development as trying on possible selves rather than working on yourself. Its OK to be inconsistent from one day to the next. That’s not being a fake; it’s how we experiment to figure out what’s right for the new challenges & circumstances we face.
- Chameleons arrived much faster at an authentic but more skillful style than the true-to-selfers in the study, who continued to focus solely on demonstrating technical mastery.
- Fact is that leaders are still expected to express ideas assertively, to claim credit for them & to use charisma to motivate & inspire people.
- The only way we grow as leaders is by stretching the limits of who we are - doing new things that make us uncomfortable but that teach us through direct experience who we want to become. Small changes - in the way we carry ourselves, way we communicate, way we interact - often make a world of difference in how effectively we lead.
### Managing your Boss
- Managers who work effectively with their bosses, seek out information about the boss’s goals, problems & pressures. They are alert for opportunities to question the boss and others around him/her to test their assumptions.
- Some people’s instinctive reaction is to resent the boss’s authority and to rebel against the boss’s decisions.
- The subordinate’s reactions to being constrained are usually strong & sometimes impulsive. He/she sees the boss as someone who, by virtue of the role, is a hindrance to progress, an obstacle to be circumvented or at best tolerated.
### How Leaders Create & Use Networks
- Exchanges & interactions with a diverse array of current & potential stakeholders are not distractions from their “real work” but are actually at the heart of their new leadership roles.
- 3 distinct forms of networking: operational, personal & strategic.
  - Operational network: Include not only direct reports & superiors but also peers within an operational unit, other internal players with the power to block or support a project, and key outsiders such as suppliers, distributors & customers.
  - Personal networking: Through professional associations, alumni groups, clubs & personal interest communities, managers gain new perspectives that allow them to advance their careers.
  - Strategic network: Key is leverage, the ability to marshal information, support & resources from one sector of a network to achieve results in another. Strategic networkers use indirect influence, convincing one person in the network to get someone else, who is not in the network, to take a needed action.
- It is a challenge to make the leap from a lifetime of functional contributions and hands on control to the ambiguous process of building & working through networks.
- What differentiates a leader from a manager is the ability to figure out where to go and to enlist the people & groups necessary to get there.
### How Managers Become Leaders
- To transition successfully to a leadership role executives must undergo these Seven Seismic Shifts: 
  - Specialist to Generalist; 
  - Analyst to Integrator;
  - Tactician to Strategist;
  - Bricklayer to Architect;
  - Problem solver to agenda setter;
  - Warrior to Diplomat;
  - Supporting cast member to lead role
  For the most parts these seven shifts involve switching from left brain, analytical thinking to right brain conceptual mind sets.
- The skills that got you where you are may not be the requisite skills to get you to where you need to go. This doesn’t discount the accomplishments of your past, but they will not be everything you need for the next leg of the journey.
