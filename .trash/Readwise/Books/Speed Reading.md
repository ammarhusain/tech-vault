- whenever you pick up something to read, state the purpose or intention for reading it. ... The key is to determine why you are reading the text or what you want to know once finished. ... Two universal examples include: What can I get out of this material or How will reading it help me? ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HQM9G1R&location=234))

- Articles and Reports   Read the first and last paragraphs, examine words in bold or italics, read any quoted texts, and glance at any illustrations.   Books and Manuals   Read the front and back covers. Review the table of contents to get a feel for organization, and notice if the book is divided into sections or parts. Read chapter headings to get a sense of the topics that will be covered.   Next, read samples of the text. If there is a preface, begin there. Read also the full introduction and conclusion. Finally, skim through the book and take note of items in bold, italics, quotes, and any diagrams or tables. ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HQM9G1R&location=358))

- The solution, therefore, is to not focus on single words but rather to expand visual awareness and see groups of words at one time. This is the natural way the mind absorbs information from sight. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HQM9G1R&location=591))

- Space Reading directs you to avoid looking at the words you are reading, but rather at the spaces in between the words. That's right—at the spaces between words! ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HQM9G1R&location=608))

- Subvocalization greatly reduces the speed at which you read by adding an unnecessary step, or steps, to your reading. In addition to seeing the word, you are also hearing and/or speaking it.   The problem is that speech is a relatively slow activity. Our mind can’t say words as fast as it can see them. This makes it impossible to read faster than we talk. ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HQM9G1R&location=783))

- By fixating on every word in a sentence, it takes longer to get to the point the writer is trying to communicate. This creates impatience, lack of interest, and loss of focus. Losing focus causes comprehension to suffer further, and eventually, the desire to read altogether.   To increase reading speed and comprehension, it makes sense then to manage eye fixation. Although essential to reading—and to seeing in general—it can be reduced significantly. ([Location 928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HQM9G1R&location=928))

- regression, which is similar to fixation, but instead of stopping to look at words you are reading, you stop to go back to words you’ve already read. So, regression is the act of reading the same text multiple times. ([Location 996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HQM9G1R&location=996))
- purpose directs attention and focus. With a well-defined purpose, the mind’s awareness opens, and its focus changes. It hones in on the task of reading and seeking the precise information you seek. Since the mind is immersed in the content, it does not get lost in thought and miss what is being read, eliminating the need to regress.

- purpose helps direct attention and focus. With a clearly defined purpose, the mind’s awareness opens and its focus changes. It hones in on the task of reading and seeks the precise answer you desire. Since the mind is immersed in the content, it does not get lost in other thoughts and miss what is being read, thus eliminating the need to regress.

- If you’ve never worked on expanding peripheral range, chances are that it isn’t very wide. Therefore, the number of extra words it can capture is limited. If that’s the case, then in addition to training yourself to use the peripheral while reading, you also want to widen it.
