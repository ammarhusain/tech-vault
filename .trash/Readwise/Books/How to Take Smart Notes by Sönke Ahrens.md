## Highlights
- The slip-box system is a method of taking notes and organizing them that fosters the creation and publication of original ideas. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/ef1d9ccb-28b9-474d-b65c-4ea3f6cd4fc1))
- Ahrens recommends taking three types of notes: temporary notes, literature notes, and evergreen notes. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/26fd6dc8-c171-425a-b7a8-d7a8a61d34a0))
- some of the best readers he knows engage with literature by reading with a purpose or incorporating the ideas they read about into creative projects. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/9b1dc885-9093-4f65-a662-0be65ac48fad))
- Each day, go over the notes in your in-tray and any notes you’ve already collected in your slip-box. As you do so, think to yourself: How do these ideas compare with and connect to each other? When you have an original thought about these connections, create a new note—ensuring that each original idea has its own note. Use full sentences, be as clear and concise as possible, and include citations. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/9d32f776-ea2a-4f3e-b35e-b82bb21f65f5))
- Each day, go over the notes in your in-tray and any notes you’ve already collected in your slip-box. As you do so, think to yourself: How do these ideas compare with and connect to each other? When you have an original thought about these connections, create a new note—ensuring that each original idea has its own note. Use full sentences, be as clear and concise as possible, and include citations.
  This evergreen note should stand on its own; you shouldn’t have to refer to other material to understand it. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/9daab490-cbc7-48d7-a8b9-a9bf337b634b))
- Although your evergreen notes should contain only one concept, Matuschak urges you to “capture the entirety” of that concept: He warns that evergreen notes that are too narrow will make seeing useful connections more difficult because you’ll have ever-smaller links between notes; evergreen notes that are too broad will do the same because you’ll have too many links to the same note—making those connections unclear.

- Once you’ve encapsulated the ideas from your temporary notes into a permanent note, you can throw the temporary note away. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/0d95dc46-d0d1-418d-a6b5-93dd6fad5058))
- Once you have notes in your slip-box, the next step is to link them to your index. This is any document with a list of topics with references to the notes on which those topics are mentioned. You use it to navigate the collection of notes in your slip-box so that you can find the right idea when you need it.

- Once you’ve created several notes, Ahrens argues, you’ll have enough notes to know what you want to write about. When this occurs, pull out all the notes in your slip-box related to that topic. Rearrange them in a logical way: Ahrens contends that since all these notes are your own ideas, doing so will naturally reveal some form of argument. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/436a69c3-95b5-495a-b39a-5fc9788dc140))
- you think as you write, so your ideas may change as you write your draft. Your notes are meant to help you develop your argument—they don’t necessarily have to be the argument. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/355d1b8a-9ad2-4166-824a-eea95fe58fde))
- traditional note-taking methods focus on capturing others’ ideas instead of thinking extensively about them. So even if you’ve taken lots of notes by the time you sit down to write, you still haven’t thought about or developed your argument. You only do that when you sit in front of your blank screen—and that’s what intimidates you, not the writing itself. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/adab7ed7-3425-4735-b057-ce08bfa22cfc))
- by making you write at every stage, the slip-box system moves this thinking work far earlier in the process—so by the time you face the blank screen, you’ve already thought extensively about what you’re going to say and no longer feel intimidated by it. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/bbaa54eb-b259-44db-85f9-d9cc169bcf1c))
- Writing your thoughts down frees up brainpower to focus on other ideas. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/a035bfb3-3550-4777-8f97-611859c2c99d))
- By converting your thoughts into a physical format, you gain the physical distance necessary to critically analyze them. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/d8b38d32-0c4e-48a4-9a81-86c6fc81ad03))
- if you use the slip-box system, you never lack source material on your chosen topic. In this system, you’re not researching to prove a thesis but to grow your slip-box—in other words, to increase the number of original ideas you have. You then develop your thesis based on the ideas you collected in these notes. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/9cb3b4e2-07db-480c-a322-55611adcace8))
- If you can’t clearly and concisely summarize an author’s idea in your own words in a literature note, this is feedback that you don’t understand the idea well—and prompts you to clarify your understanding of the idea when you’re taking notes instead of when you’re writing a draft. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/39915887-0922-4e49-bf0d-01ea7db31743))
- slip-box system fosters creative insights by mimicking how your brain works. Ahrens explains that learning in the brain involves connecting new information to information you already know. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/70c89250-d6c4-4188-bced-58a59ccaaf1e))
- creativity involves connecting various pieces of information in original ways. Ahrens adds that most creative insights result from thinking a lot about a particular topic, then connecting those ideas to something new in an original way.
