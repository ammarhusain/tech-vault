## Highlights
- My night thoughts lately have been along the lines of 'Do I have it to me to do another computer game? Is this what to do? Can I do it? What if the codewriting part of my brain has atrophied? Will I fail ignominiously? Should I just turn to screenwriting full-time?"
  Then again, maybe feeling good doesn't necessarily mean that what I write is good. Maybe the best stuff is produced nut of blackest despair Or maybe not. (Page 22)
- That kind of attention to detail is why the Apple version took me two years. This version is probably the best I'll ever get out of them.
  Oddly enough, this makes me more psyched to do the new game. It reminded me why I'm good at this of what I can do that others can't, or won't. (Page 31)
- I restrained myself from taking all my work papers home with me yesterday... and I'm restraining myself from going to work today. There must be Balance. (Page 44)
    - Note: He is in the “zone”. But then later he hits patches of extreme unproductivity. I guess it’s normal for everyone.
- This is the first time in my life I've had to lobby so hard for something I desperately wanted, and it's exquisitely frustrating. It's so painful wanting something from someone, being reduced to wishing and hoping they'll give it to me. I hate it. (Page 47)
- I gotta finish this damn computer game.
  God, I'm restless; I want everything to start happening now. I want to fast-forward through the next five months of grueling work and just be there. (Page 76)
- I've been thinking more and more that I need some kind of major life change. I've never felt so restless. Maybe after PoP ships I should enroll in the directing program at AFI, or USC. (Page 83)
- Doug told Tomi that PoP is the only product Broderbund has in the works that he thinks will be a hit. "It's been four years since we had a hit," he said.
  Joe from Tech Support cornered me and talked for ten minutes about how my game is "setting a new standard."
  All I have to do is finish it. (Page 93)
    - Note: Have the ability to work through high expectations & pressure. Have the confidence from the get go without it getting in your head, ie over confident. Be grounded- no daydreaming or building castles in the sky
- I'm a little nervous to be forging ahead like this, considering the millions of bugs I'm leaving behind (for now), but if I don't plunge into it, it'll never get done. (Page 94)
- I did something almost unprecedented in our relationship: I argued back. To my surprise, Brian not only caved but ended up practically apologizing.
  It made me realize how much I usually avoid confrontation. Conflict always gives me the anxious feeling that I need to say something to defuse the situation and restore goodwill, even if it's at my own expense. Today, I realized the formidable power of acting tough. Not only did I get my way, I actually gained goodwill points, because I made Brian feel bad for having upsel me. There's a lesson in that. I need to develop the ability to stand my ground, (Page 105)
- Oh well, it's a cold cruel world out there. If I'm going to be a movie director someday, I'd better learn to deal with it.
  June 8, 1989
  I don't think I have it in me to write and direct films. Where is the strength going to come from to persevere, to fight all those battles, when even this current situation with Broderbund is -near-ideal as it is - is burning me out? Have I ever had what it takes? Am I losing it? Give me a signal; show me a sign. Where's the meaning in all this? Nobody cares about the fucking game, not even me. Why am I doing this? (Page 119)
- It's true: people like you better if you stand up for yourself.
  There's no percentage in being selfeffacing and making them think they can walk all over you. (Page 121)
- Everyone has their own particular form of selfdestruction. Mine, I'm starting to think, is standing outside myself, watching myself live my life, turning my face so as to give the cameras a better angle, and thus missing the whole thing. (Page 123)
- I hadn't realized how spoiled I was by Karateka's success. If I'm going to survive as a filmmaker over the long haul, I'd better learn to deal with failure a lot better than this. Maybe I need to care less about commercial success and concentrate more on fulfilling my own artistic goals. Spending a year hanging out with impoverished intellectuals in NY might be a good thing. (Page 195)
- Maureen said kindly. "You have that look like you've come back to visit your old high school, hoping to recapture the feelings you had there." She was right, of course. How pathetic. You can't go back (Page 254)
- Here I am, as free as it's possible for any one to be — free to travel, work, fall in love — and I'm holding back, like I'm waiting for my life to start. This is my life. It's not a preparation for anything — it's the thing itself. I have got to remember that. (Page 256)
- I feel better now. All I really need is to be working on something, and my existential problems will clear up — I know that. I should know it (Page 264)
- May 3, 1992 About sixteen people have told me I'm "timid." Even Jamil, the other night, remarked, "When you first came, you were very quiet. Now you're starting to relax more. I can see the difference."
  What the fuck is that? I'm not timid. Why do I come across that way?
  I should make up a little litany to repeat to myself every time I find myself at a party among strangers or meeting people for the first time, "I don't have to prove anything. I don't have to impress anybody.
  These people are as bored with the usual formulas as I am. All they want is a human connection, to snap them out of themselves. They want to laugh and have a good time and feel something, for God's sake, the same as I do." (Page 268)
- I know myself well enough to know that whatever happens, it won't be my excesses I'll regret, it'll be the things I held myself back from doing. In all my life I've never yet given a present so lavish, or made a gesture so expansive, or indulged a pleasure so recklessly that I regretted it later. Whereas there are so many things I look back on now and think: "That was one of the high points, that moment will never come again, why did I hold back?" (Page 300)
