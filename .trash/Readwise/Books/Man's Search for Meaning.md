## Highlights
### Experiences in a Concentration Camp
- It is not the physical pain which hurts the most, it is the mental agony caused by the injustice, the unreasonableness of it all.
- Even the strongest of us was longing for the time when he would have fairly good food again, not for the sake of good food itself, but for the sake of knowing that the sub-human existence, which had made us unable to think of anything other than food, would at last cease.
- The salvation of man is through love and in love.
- A man's suffering is similar to the behavior of gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the 'size' of human suffering is absolutely relative.
- This was the result of a strong feeling that fate was one's master, and that one must not try to influence it in any way, but instead let it take its own course.
- But what about human liberty? Is there no spiritual freedom in regard to behavior and reaction to any given surroundings? Is that theory true which would have us believe that man is no more than a product of many conditional and environmental factors; be they of a biological, psychological or sociological nature? The experiences of camp life show that man does have a choice of action. Man can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind, even in such terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress. Fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what shall become of him; mentally and spiritually. He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp.
    - Note: This is in contradiction with my Schopenhauerian belief of 'no free will'
- Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not.
- Often it is just such an exceptionally difficult external situation which gives man the opportunity to grow spiritually beyond himself.
- It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the future; sub specie aeternitatis.
- 'Life' does not mean something vague, but something very real and concrete, just as life's tasks are also very real and concrete. They form man's destiny, which is different and unique for each individual. No man and no destiny can be compared with any other man or any other destiny. Sometimes the situation in which a man finds himself may require him to shape his own fate by action. At other times it is more advantageous for him to make use of an opportunity for contemplation and to realize assets in this way. Sometimes man may be required simply to accept fate, to bear his cross. When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single and unique task. His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden.
- Once the meaning of suffering had been revealed to us, we refused to minimize or alleviate the camp's tortures by ignoring them or harboring false illusions and entertaining artificial optimism. There was no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer.
- Apart from the moral deformity resulting from the sudden release of mental pressure, there were two other fundamental experiences which threatened to damage the character of the liberated prisoner: bitterness and disillusionment when he returned to his former life.
### Logotherapy in a Nutshell
- Logotherapy: according to it, this striving to find a meaning in oneâ€™s life is the primary motivational force in man. That is why I speak of a 'will to meaning' rather than 'will to pleasure' (on which Freudian psychoanalysis is centered), or 'will to power' on which Alderian psychology: striving for superiority is focused.
- Mans search for meaning is the primary motivation in life, rather than a secondary rationalization of instinctual drives.
- A mans concern/despair over the worth-whileness of life is an existential distress but by no means a mental disease.
- Sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do. Instead he either wishes to do what other people do (conformism) or he does what other people wish him to do (totalitarianism).
- Schopenhauer said that mankind was apparently doomed to vacillate eternally between the two extremes of distress and boredom.
- Widespread phenomena as depression, aggression and addiction are not understandable unless we recognize the existential vacuum underlying them. There are various masks & guises under which this vacuum appears. The frustrated will to meaning is vicariously compensated by a will to power, the will to money, will to pleasure etc.
- Meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day, and from hour to hour. It is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a persons life at a given moment. To put the question in general would be comparable to a question posed to a chess champion: 'what is the best move in the world?'. One should not search for an abstract meaning of life. Everyone's task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it.
- Each man is questioned by life, and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.
- Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!
- The true meaning of life is to be discovered in the world rather than within man or his own psyche. We can discover this meaning in 3 different ways:
  (i) by creating a work or doing a deed,
  (ii) by experiencing something or encountering someone, 
  (iii) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.
- Our current mental hygiene philosophy stresses the idea that people ought to be happy, that unhappiness is a symptom of maladjustment. The burden of unavoidable unhappiness is increased by unhappiness about being unhappy. Present day culture is where the incurable sufferer is given very little opportunity to be proud of his suffering and to consider it ennobling rather than degrading.
- In the past, nothing is irretrievably lost but everything irrevocably stored.
- Paradoxical Intention: The phobic patient is invited to intend, even if for a moment, precisely that which he fears. This procedure consists of a reversal of the patients attitude, inasmuch as his fear is replaced by a paradoxical wish. By this treatment, the wind is taken out of the sails of anxiety. The patient is enabled to put himself at a distance from his own neurosis. Basic capacity to detach oneself from oneself is actualized.
- Paradoxical Intention lends itself as a useful tool in treating obsessive compulsive and phobic conditions, especially in cases with underlying anticipatory anxiety.
- As for the actual causation of neuroses, apart from constitutional elements be it somatic or psychic, feedback mechanisms such as anticipatory anxiety seem to be a major pathogenic factor. A given symptom is responded to by a phobia, the phobia triggers the symptom, and the symptom in turn reinforces the phobia. In obsessive compulsive cases, the patient fights the ideas which haunt him. Thereby, however, he increases their power to disturb him, since pressure precipitates counter-pressure. Anticipatory anxiety has to be counteracted by paradoxical intention. As soon as the patient stops fighting his obsessions and instead tries to ridicule them by dealing with them in an ironical way (by paradoxical intention); the vicious circle is cut, the symptom diminishes and finally atrophies.
- As the focus of striving shifts from the conflict to selfless goals, the life as a whole becomes sounder even though the neurosis may never completely disappear.
- Man is capable of changing the world for the better if possible, and of changing himself for the better if necessary.
- Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsible-ness. In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsible-ness.
- In modern times, people have enough to live by but nothing to live for; they have the means but no meaning.
- 'Existential vacuum', a feeling of emptiness and meaninglessness.
- You must realize that the world is a joke. There is no justice, everything is random. Only when you realize this will you understand how silly it is to take yourself seriously. There is no grand purpose in the universe. It just is. There's no particular meaning in what decision you make today about how to act.
- Sed omnia praeclara tam dificilia quam rara sunt (but everything great is just as difficult to realize as it is rare to find), reads the last sentence of the Ethics of Spinoza.
- Since Auschwitz we know what man is capable of, and since Hiroshima we know what is at stake.
- Don't aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long-runâ€”in the long-run, I say!â€”success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it
