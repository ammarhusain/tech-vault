## Highlights
- when replying to an email, you should articulate: 1) the current state of things, 2) what the ultimate goal is, and 3) what the most effective next steps are. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/500577d8-fd81-4b8b-bf08-ae91d6dce864))
- Dale Carnegie says that setting small goals or challenges makes work a bit like an enjoyable game and prevents you from becoming bored or zoning out. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/cedc4128-1a32-418f-851d-46c08a36293a))
- Focus on what’s important. When choosing what to work on, figure out what things have the largest impact. Then, instead of trying to say no to trivial distractions, simply say yes to the most important task or goal.

- The most useful metrics in deep work are leading metrics, or metrics you can use in real-time to tweak what your result will be. For example, Newport suggests leading metrics like the number of pages you’ve written or the number of new ideas you’ve generated. These give real-time feedback that helps you see how effective you are at deep work. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/7712673f-d190-4668-bb37-a03c2bbca6dd))
- You may want to add reflective time into your workday shutdown—research shows that employees who spend 15 minutes at the end of their workday reflecting on what they learned during the day perform about 23% better in their work than those who don’t take time for reflection.

- Remove as many shallow work tasks from your life as possible; delegate as many as possible to assistants. Spend nearly all your time on deep work. Like a monk, you spend your time somewhat isolated and in deep focus on your work. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/e28fd25d-794e-4da0-9398-89869a8a2822))
- Carve out regular periods each week, month, or entire parts of the year to focus on deep work. The book stresses that the period should be at least one full day to reach the maximum intensity of deep work. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/22b526f7-2dc1-48e4-b3ea-0db29b4e947d))
- Set aside the morning (such as 8 to 11 a.m.) for deep work, before jumping into shallow work ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/d2585ed0-36ab-4174-9e71-9a0fb8e59f12))
- most novices can only accomplish about an hour a day of intense concentration. Experts who have extensive practice can expand to up to four hours, but rarely are able to exceed this. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/13813a26-b606-4951-b558-2d2f5baa2972))
- Newport recommends giving yourself intense deadlines—this will force you to concentrate at the limit of your ability to make the deadline. There’s no way you can give in to distraction and still make your deadline. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/39a69a96-e3cf-4aba-b31c-e72ee1f33abb))
- Newport recommends giving yourself intense deadlines—this will force you to concentrate at the limit of your ability to make the deadline. There’s no way you can give in to distraction and still make your deadline.
  To do this, estimate how long you’d normally schedule for the task. Then cut down the time drastically, and set it as your deadline. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/1d348955-5ca3-431b-a746-b6240e798ea4))
- First, make a list of your most important goals—professional and personal—and then list the two or three activities that help you progress most toward these goals. Newport notes that these activities should be specific enough to give you direction, but general enough to be repeatable. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/2fd840e1-9a47-4557-9c6f-3ef317267d9e))
- He points out that by always filling in these low-stimuli moments with a high-stimuli activity, you deplete your brain’s ability to tolerate boredom.
  Even if you set aside time for deep work, you won’t be able to do the work during that time unless you strengthen your brain’s “focus muscles.” Newport suggests consciously letting yourself be bored in these low-stimuli moments. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/3d0f3ecb-fdaa-434d-8687-d1d2749a8c55))
- Newport describes productive meditation as thinking about a problem while doing a low-intensity physical activity, like walking or showering. This environment helps problem-solving in two ways: First, the activity typically takes you away from distractions like your smartphone. Secondly, you train your ability to focus on the problem at hand, rather than daydream. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/a9c997b7-cd9f-4a91-bcdf-f8006117c746))
- You may find it difficult to switch your brain over from work mode to relaxation mode. Researchers recommend low-key activities like walking, crafting, and gardening that keep you a bit busy but allow your mind to unwind.

- When choosing what to work on, figure out what things have the largest impact. Then, instead of trying to say no to trivial distractions, simply say yes to the most important task or goal. This process helps crowd out shallow tasks that don’t support your goals. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/566221c1-8b95-4283-ba42-8de7198a83ae))
- Studies show that continuously celebrating small achievements and feeling a sense of progress is a fairly easy way to boost your overall happiness—this is important because the strongest indicator of productivity is the way you feel.
