## Highlights
- "In and for itself, as minerals and chemicals, the natural world will survive humankind. Whether it will re-create the means of life necessary to our species, or to beings resembling our species, is not within our ken. The environmental catastrophe we think of as the ruin of nature is in fact the ruin of human nature, the end of our sustainable life on earth. Perhaps, beyond disaster, we might discover in this history of ruins something ephemeral that is both significant and beautiful, something, as Wordsworth once said, 'akin to life' that can guide us on to life." (Page 7)
- Lines of code are being steadily replaced by neural nets, which do the same thing better by virtue of not being handmade. Soon, the pathways between my neurons firing and yours, on the other side of the world, will be neural from end to end. (Page 25)
- Tradition holds that the difference between science fiction and fantasy is temporal; that science fiction is about an imagined future while fantasy is about an imagined past. Or perhaps the hara stan marks the boundary, with realist literature and science fiction uneasily sharing the territory on the near side, and fantasy in the lands beyond.
  Or perhaps again, it's better to acknowledge that the coordinates of these genres are neither Cartesian nor polar; they are local, and the curvature of narrative spacetime is only evident when we broaden our view of stories beyond the narrow frame of the twentieth century publishingindustrial complex. (Page 59)
- Thinking about it a little more, it occurs to me that this is how improv works too. It doesn't take much of a prompt. You use general knowledge and your imagination to plausibly fill in and develop a persona, even if the starting point is the feeblest of kernels.
  It's disturbing. Like we've all been left naked and humiliated as AI strikes off the list, one by one, all of the things we used to think were our human special sauce.
  Worse, these things turn out to be trivial. (Page 103)
