## Highlights
- Almost all of the people I look up to and try to steal from today, regardless of their profession, have built sharing into their routine. These people aren’t schmoozing at cocktail parties; they’re too busy for that. They’re cranking away in their studios, their laboratories, or their cubicles, but instead of maintaining absolute secrecy and hoarding their work, they’re open about what they’re working on, and they’re consistently posting bits and pieces of their work, their ideas, and what they’re learning online. ([Location 26](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=26))
- “ecology of talent.” If you look back closely at history, many of the people who we think of as lone geniuses were actually part of “a whole scene of people who were supporting each other, looking at each other’s work, copying from each other, stealing ideas, and contributing ideas.” Scenius doesn’t take away from the achievements of those great individuals; it just acknowledges that good work isn’t created in a vacuum, and that creativity is always, in some sense, a collaboration, the result of a mind connected to other minds. ([Location 54](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=54))
- Because they have little to lose, amateurs are willing to try anything and share the results. They take chances, experiment, and follow their whims. Sometimes, in the process of doing things in an unprofessional way, they make new discoveries. “In the beginner’s mind, there are many possibilities,” said Zen monk Shunryu Suzuki. “In the expert’s mind, there are few.” ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=74))
- Amateurs are not afraid to make mistakes or look ridiculous in public. They’re in love, so they don’t hesitate to do work that others think of as silly or just plain stupid. ([Location 77](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=77))
- Amateurs know that contributing something is better than contributing nothing. Amateurs might lack formal training, but they’re all lifelong learners, and they make a point of learning in the open, so that others can learn from their failures and successes. ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=81))
- The world is changing at such a rapid rate that it’s turning us all into amateurs. Even for professionals, the best way to flourish is to retain an amateur’s spirit and embrace uncertainty and the unknown. ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=91))
- The best way to get started on the path to sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others. Find a scenius, pay attention to what others are sharing, and then start taking note of what they’re not sharing. Be on the lookout for voids that you can fill with your own efforts, no matter how bad they are at first. ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=97))
    - Note: Questions for a new tool:
      What was it made for?
      How are other people using it?
      What use can I find for it?
- It sounds a little extreme, but in this day and age, if your work isn’t online, it doesn’t exist. We all have the opportunity to use our voices, to have our say, but so many of us are wasting it. If you want people to know about what you do and the things you care about, you have to share. ([Location 119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=119))
- “Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked.” —Steve Jobs ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=122))

- Thinking about death every morning makes me want to live. Try it: Start reading the obituaries every morning. Take inspiration from the people who muddled through life before you—they all started out as amateurs, and they got where they were going by making do with what they were given, and having the guts to put themselves out there. ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=145))
- Become a documentarian of what you do. Start a work journal: Write your thoughts down in a notebook, or speak them into an audio recorder. Keep a scrapbook. Take a lot of photographs of your work at different stages in your process. Shoot video of you working. This isn’t about making art, it’s about simply keeping track of what’s going on around you. ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=197))
- Whether you share it or not, documenting and recording your process as you go along has its own rewards: You’ll start to see the work you’re doing more clearly and feel like you’re making progress. And when you’re ready to share, you’ll have a surplus of material to choose from. ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=201))
- Once a day, after you’ve done your day’s work, go back to your documentation and find one little piece of your process that you can share. Where you are in your process will determine what that piece is. If you’re in the very early stages, share your influences and what’s inspiring you. If you’re in the middle of executing a project, write about your methods or share works in progress. If you’ve just completed a project, show the final product, share scraps from the cutting-room floor, or write about what you learned. If you have lots of projects out into the world, you can report on how they’re doing—you can tell stories about how people are interacting with your work. ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=211))
- Don’t worry about everything you post being perfect. Science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon once said that 90 percent of everything is crap. The same is true of our own work. The trouble is, we don’t always know what’s good and what sucks. That’s why it’s important to get things in front of others and see how they react. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=235))
- “Carving out a space for yourself online, somewhere where you can express yourself and share your work, is still one of the best possible investments you can make with your time.” —Andy Baio ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=280))
- Don’t think of your website as a self-promotion machine, think of it as a self-invention machine. Online, you can become the person you really want to be. Fill your website with your work and your ideas and the stuff you care about. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=295))
- Our tastes make us what we are, but they can also cast a shadow over our own work. “All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste,” says public radio personality Ira Glass. “But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer.” ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=323))
- Human beings want to know where things came from, how they were made, and who made them. The stories you tell about the work you do have a huge effect on how people feel and what they understand about your work, and how people feel and what they understand about your work affects how they value it. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=399))
- A good pitch is set up in three acts: The first act is the past, the second act is the present, and the third act is the future. The first act is where you’ve been—what you want, how you came to want it, and what you’ve done so far to get it. The second act is where you are now in your work and how you’ve worked hard and used up most of your resources. The third act is where you’re going, and how exactly the person you’re pitching can help you get there. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=431))
- The minute you learn something, turn around and teach it to others. Share your reading list. Point to helpful reference materials. Create some tutorials and post them online. Use pictures, words, and video. ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=497))
- You can’t plan on anything; you can only go about your work, as Isak Dinesen wrote, “every day, without hope or despair.” You can’t count on success; you can only leave open the possibility for it, and be ready to jump on and take the ride when it comes for you. ([Location 742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=742))
- Author Ernest Hemingway would stop in the middle of a sentence at the end of his day’s work so he knew where to start in the morning. ([Location 758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=758))
- “The minute you stop wanting something you get it.” —Andy Warhol ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=767))
- “Anyone who isn’t embarrassed of who they were last year probably isn’t learning enough,” writes author Alain de Botton. ([Location 795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RGGI&location=795))
