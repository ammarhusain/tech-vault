## Highlights
- Good communication leads to feeling great, being assertive, living in harmony with others and finding success. This applies to our personal lives, our work, our relationships and every other area of our lives. Good, effective communication brings the results we want by giving us the ability to make ourselves clearly understood, to build strong relationships and connections with others and to successfully persuade others to support us.

- Awareness is being awake and alert to what is going on both inside and around you. The inner and outer aspects of awareness are intricately linked, because when self-awareness increases, you will automatically become more aware of the world around you and more sensitive to the needs and reactions of others. To become more self-aware you have to undertake some self-analysis and ask yourself questions about why some things work out for you and others don’t. It means concentrating on your strengths while looking hard at what doesn’t work in your life, finding out why and changing it.

- Flexibility means that you can respond and adjust appropriately to what you see or know. It means that you have the ability to adapt according to the situation you are in. Flexibility follows on from awareness; the greater your awareness the easier you will find it to be flexible. ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GW4WHIQ&location=209))
- Choose rapport as your primary objective, rather than ‘winning’ and you will win more often. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GW4WHIQ&location=227))
- When you allow yourself to be open and relaxed you will discover your natural charisma. Most people would like to be considered ‘charismatic’ and imagine that this is a quality that other people possess. But being charismatic doesn’t come from doing anything difficult or complicated or from being glamorous or famous. Communication research over the last thirty years has revealed that what comes across as charisma is really expressiveness. Which means being open and willing to communicate, verbally and non-verbally. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GW4WHIQ&location=299))
- Effective communication is a two-way exchange between two people – you and one other. Even in a situation where you are addressing more than one person, each person you are trying to influence will decide whether you’ve affected them or not. So often people think of an audience as an amorphous blob of people. Think of an audience as just one person and your focus and intention will be on talking to individuals. ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GW4WHIQ&location=313))
- If you want to do something, be definite about it. Being definite means having a purpose or a pure, strong intent. When you are definite it brings what you want into the present and allows you to do it and speak about it with genuine conviction and clarity. ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GW4WHIQ&location=338))
- Effective communication involves far more than just words. It involves behaviour, appearance, gestures and unspoken empathy as well. People are more influenced by who you are and how you behave than by what you are actually saying. ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GW4WHIQ&location=353))
- The most important thing is to create a clear idea of exactly what you want and why you want it. ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GW4WHIQ&location=392))
- Press on; nothing in the world can take the place of perseverance. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination are omnipotent. Press on CALVIN COOLIDGE ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GW4WHIQ&location=408))
- Why would any of us block ourselves? There’s only one answer to that: fear. There are all kinds of fears that surface when you set out to achieve a goal that defines and stretches you. There’s fear of failure, fear of success, fear of change, fear of not being good enough and fear of standing up to be counted. And that’s just for starters. Getting your intention clear is about facing your fears full in the face and finding the courage to carry on anyway.

- She sees people who sell themselves as self-centred and pushy and this is blocking her. The belief that there are ‘creative’ people who don’t sell and ‘pushy’ people who do goes back to her childhood. ([Location 515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GW4WHIQ&location=515))
