## Highlights
- Whether you've never picked up a knife or you're an accomplished chef, there are only four basic factors that determine how good your food will taste: salt, which enhances flavor; fat, which amplifies flavor and makes appealing textures possible; acid, which brightens and balances; and heat, which ultimately determines the texture of food.
  Salt, Fat, Acid, and Heat are the four cardinal directions of cooking. (Page 5)
- Our taste buds can perceive five tastes: saltiness, sourness, bitterness, sweetness, and umami, or savoriness.
  On the other hand, aroma involves our noses sensing any of thousands of various chemical compounds. The descriptive words often used to characterize the way a wine smells, such as earthy, fruity, and floral, refer to aroma compounds.
  Flavor lies at the intersection of taste, aroma, and sensory elements including texture, sound, appearance, and temperature. Since aroma is a crucial element of flavor, the more aromas you perceive, the more vibrant your eating experience will be. (Page 26)
- The unseasoned broth will taste flat, but as you add salt, you'll detect new aromas that were previously unavailable. Keep salting, and tasting, and you'll start to sense the salt as well as more complex and delightful flavors: the savoriness of the chicken, the richness of the chicken fat, the earthiness of the celery and the thyme. Keep adding salt, and tasting, until you get that zing!
  This flavor "unlocking" is also one reason why professional cooks like to season sliced tomatoes a few minutes before serving them so that, as salt helps release the flavor molecules that are bound up within the tomato proteins, each bite will taste more intensely of tomato.
  Salt also reduces our perception of bitterness, with the secondary effect of emphasizing other flavors present in bitter dishes (Page 26)
- Water will also be visible on the surface of the chicken, the result of osmosis. While the salt moves in, the water will move out with the same goal: achieving chemical balance throughout the entire piece of meat.
  Since diffusion is a slow process, seasoning in advance gives salt plenty of time to diffuse evenly throughout meat. (Page 30)
- Think of a protein strand as a loose coil with water molecules bound to its outside surface. When an unseasoned protein is heated, it denatures: the coil unravels, releasing water molecules out of the protein matrix, leaving the meat dry and tough if overcooked.
  By disrupting protein structure, salt prevents the coil from densely coagulating, or clumping, when heated, so more of the water molecules remain bound. The piece of meat remains moister, and you have a greater margin of error for overcooking.
  This same chemical process is the secret to brining, the method in which a piece of meat is submerged in a bath of water spiked with salt, sugar, and spices. (Page 31)
- Lean meat has a slightly higher water (and protein) content-and thus, greater capacity for salt absorption (Page 32)
- Most vegetables and fruit cells contain an undigestible carbohydrate called pectin. Salt assists in weakening pectin.
  When in doubt, salt vegetables before you cook them. Toss vegetables with salt and olive oil for roasting - usually 15 mins before cooking is sufficient. (Page 33)
- In an attempt to reach equilibrium, the green beans will absorb some salt from the water as they cook, seasoning themselves from the inside out. They'll also remain more vibrantly colored because the salt balance will keep magnesium in the beans' chlorophyll molecules from leaching out. The salt will also weaken the pectin and soften the beans' cell walls, allowing them to cook more quickly. As an added bonus, there will be less of an opportunity for the green beans to lose nutrients because they'll spend less total time in the pot. (Page 35)
- To determine which role fat is playing in a dish, ask yourself these questions:
  - Will this fat bind various ingredients together? If so, this is a main ingredient.
  - Does this fat play a textural role? For flaky, creamy, and light textures, fat plays the role of main ingredient, while for crisp textures, it's a cooking medium. For tender textures, fat can play either role.
  - Will this fat be heated and used to cook the food? If so, this is a cooking medium.
  - Does this fat play a flavor role? If it's added at the outset, it's a main ingredient. If it's used to adjust flavor or texture at the end of cooking the dish as a garnish, it's a seasoning. (Page 62)
- For food to become crisp, the water trapped in its cells must evaporate. Water evaporates as it boils, so the surface temperature of the ingredient must climb beyond the boiling point of 212°F.
  To achieve this effect on the entire surface of the food, it needs to be in direct, even contact with a heat source, such as a pan at temperatures well beyond water's boiling point. But no food is perfectly smooth, and at the microscopic level, most pans aren't either. In order to get even contact between the food and the pan, we need a medium: fat. Cooking fats can be heated to 350°F and beyond before beginning to smoke, so they are ideal media for developing the crisp, golden crusts that delight our palates so much. (Page 75)
- Intermuscular and subcutaneous fats- the lumpy bits between the muscles and the layer of fat just beneath the skin-can be cut into small pieces, placed in a pan with a minimal amount of water, and rendered, or cooked over gentle heat until all the water has evaporated. This process transforms solid fat into a liquid that can be used as a cooking medium.
  Fry at too high a temperature, and it'll burn on the outside while remaining flabby. The key is to cook it slowly enough to allow the fat to render at the same rate the meat browns.
  Animal fats begin to burn at around 350°F, (Page 77)
- The goal with all cooking is to achieve your desired result on the outside and inside of an ingredient at the same time. In this case, it's a crisp surface and a tender center. Add foods that take time to cook through, such as eggplant slices or chicken thighs, to hot fat, allowing a crust to form. Then, reduce the heat to prevent burning and allow them to cook all the way through. (Page 79)
- One of the great alchemical wonders of the kitchen, an emulsion happens when two liquids that normally don't like to mix together or dissolve give up and join together. In the kitchen, an emulsion is like a temporary peace treaty between fat and water. The result is tiny droplets of one liquid dispersed in another, resulting in a creamy mixture that's neither one nor the other. (Page 80)
- Two proteins in wheat-glutenin and gliadin-comprise gluten. When you combine wheat flour and liquid to make dough or batter, these proteins link up with one another into long chains. As dough is kneaded or batter is mixed, the chains develop into strong, extensive webs or the gluten network. The expansion of these webs is called gluten development, and it's what makes a dough chewy and elastic.
  As gluten develops, dough becomes chewier. This is why bread bakers use flours with relatively high protein content, and work hard to knead doughs for long periods of time to create crusty, chewy country loaves. Salt also preserves the strength of the gluten network.
  But pastry chefs generally seek tender, flaky, and moist textures, so they do everything they can to limit or control gluten development, including using low protein flours and avoiding overkneading. Sugar and acids such as buttermilk or yogurt also discourage gluten from developing, so adding them early on will tenderize pastries.
  Too much fat can also inhibit gluten networks from forming. By coating individual gluten strands, fat prevents them from sticking to one another and lengthening. This is where the term shortening comes from, because the gluten strands remain short instead of lengthening.
  Four main variables will determine the texture of any baked good (and some nonbaked ones, such as pasta): fat, water, yeast, and how much the dough or batter is kneaded or worked.
  Short doughs are the epitome of tenderness, crumbling and melting in your mouth.
  Here, flour and fat are blended together intimately, resulting in a smooth, homogeneous dough. Many of the shortest recipes, such as shortbread cookies, call for very soft or even melted butter, in order to encourage this now fluid fat to quickly coat individual flour particles, preventing gluten webs from forming. (Page 88)
- Lightness might not be the first quality you associate with fat, but its remarkable capacity to entrap air when whipped allows it to act as a leavening, or raising, agent in cakes and transform liquid cream into billowy clouds Some classic cakes have no chemical leavening - ie baking soda or baking powder - and rely entirely on whipped fat for their cloud like structure. And if fat isn't properly aerated, chemical leavening won't make up for it. Baking soda and powder don't introduce any new air bubbles into a batter. They simply help expand, via the release of carbon dioxide gas, air bubbles already in place. (Page 95)
- I began to see that the true value of acid is not its pucker, but rather, balance.
  Acid grants the palate relief, and makes food more appealing by offering contrast.
  Acid is salt's alter ego. While salt enhances flavors, acid balances them. By acting as a foil to salt, fat, sugar, and starch, acid makes itself indispensable to everything we cook. (Page 102)
- View everything you cook like that grilled cheese sandwich. Know what results you seek, so that you can take the steps to achieve them. Think about your goals in the kitchen in terms of flavors and textures.
  Do you want your food to be browned? Crisp? Tender? Soft? Chewy? Caramelized? Flaky? Moist?
  Next, work backward. Make a clear plan for yourself using sensory landmarks to guide you back to your goal. (Page 135)
- Choose your cooking vessel based on how steam will move within and out of it. Pans with sloped or curved sides are better at allowing steam to escape than pans with straight sides. And the taller the sides of the pan or pot, the longer it will take steam to escape.
  Deep pots and pans are great for sweating onions and simmering soups, but less ideal for foods you aim to sear and brown quickly, such as scallops and steaks (Page 139)
- Recall the osmosis that salt initiates, and weave that understanding into how you decide to use steam. Let salt do its work, drawing water out of food it touches, to help create steam when you want it in the pan. When the goal is to brown swiftly, wait to salt food until after it begins to crisp or salt far enough in advance to let osmosis occur, pat food dry, and then place into a hot pan. (Page 139)
- Found primarily in foods made from plant sources, carbohydrates provide food with both structure and flavor. In Acid, I described three types of carbohydrates-cellulose, sugars, and pectin, Along with a fourth type of carbohydrate-starches-cellulose provides much of the bulk and texture of plant-derived foods, while sugars offer flavor. When heated, carbohydrates generally absorb water and break down.
  Starches absorb liquid and swell or break down. (Page 141)
- If all you've got is a gas grill and y want to impart some smokiness to your grilled meats and vegetables, you can use wood chips. Just soak and drain a couple of handfulsI love the flavors of oak, almond, and fruit woods-in a disposable aluminum baking pan and cover with foil. Poke several holes in the foil to allow the smoke to escape. Turn on some, but not all, of the burners, place the pan over an unlit spot, and close the lid. Begin cooking once you catch the first appetizing whiffs of smoke. Close the lid to bathe your meat and vegetables in smoky flavors, which result from a series of chemical reactions, including browning. (Page 153)
- There's no recipe for meat more straightforward than "Simmer in salted water."
  Cuts of meat with lots of connective tissue, such as NERBONE PANING chicken thighs, brisket, and pork shoulder are perfect for simmering, as the water and gentle heat will transform collagen into gelatin over time without drying out the exterior.
  To yield the most flavorful meat, place it in boiling, salted water, then turn it down to a simmer. (Page 159)
