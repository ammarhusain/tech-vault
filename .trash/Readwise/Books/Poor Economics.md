## Highlights
- This urge to reduce the poor to a set of clichés has been with us for as long as there has been poverty: The poor appear, in social theory as much as in literature, by turns lazy or enterprising, noble or thievish, angry or passive, helpless or self-sufficient. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=183))
- All too often, the economics of poverty gets mistaken for poor economics: Because the poor possess very little, it is assumed that there is nothing interesting about their economic existence. ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=190))
- It is not easy to escape from poverty, but a sense of possibility and a little bit of well-targeted help (a piece of information, a little nudge) can sometimes have surprisingly large effects. On the other hand, misplaced expectations, the lack of faith where it is needed, and seemingly minor hurdles can be devastating. A push on the right lever can make a huge difference, but it is often difficult to know where that lever is. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=226))
- In his best-selling 2005 book, The End of Poverty,4 Sachs argues that if the rich world had committed $195 billion in foreign aid per year between 2005 and 2025, poverty could have been entirely eliminated by the end of this period. ... William Easterly, who battles Sachs from New York University at the other end of Manhattan, has become one of the most influential anti-aid public figures, ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=286))
- in The Life You Can Save, Singer takes the trouble to offer his readers a list of concrete examples of things that they should support, regularly updated on his Web site.12 Kristof and WuDunn do the same. ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=339))
- The lack of a grand universal answer might sound vaguely disappointing, but in fact it is exactly what a policy maker should want to know—not that there are a million ways that the poor are trapped but that there are a few key factors that create the trap, and that alleviating those particular problems could set them free and point them toward a virtuous cycle of increasing wealth and investment. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=453))
- As we will see, ideology, ignorance, and inertia—the three I’s—on the part of the expert, the aid worker, or the local policy maker, often explain why policies fail and why aid does not have the effect it should. It is possible to make the world a better place—probably not tomorrow, but in some future that is within our reach—but we cannot get there with lazy thinking. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=498))
- In terms of calories per rupee, the millets (jowar and bajra) were clearly the best buy.Yet only about two-thirds of the total spending on grains was on these grains, while another 30 percent was spent on rice and wheat, which cost on average about twice as much per calorie. ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=584))
- If the consumption of the staple is associated with being poor (say, because it is cheap but not particularly tasty), feeling richer might actually have made them consume less of it. Once again, this suggests that at least among these very poor urban households, getting more calories was not a priority: Getting better-tasting ones was.8 ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=594))
- One study finds that potatoes may have been responsible for 12 percent of the global increase in population between 1700 and 1900.11 ([Location 620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=620))
- Instead of raging against their destiny, they have made things tolerable by reducing their standards. But they don’t necessarily reduce their standards by cutting out luxuries and concentrating on necessities; more often it is the other way around—the more natural way, if you come to think of it—hence the fact that in a decade of unparalleled depression, the consumption of all cheap luxuries has increased. ([Location 834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=834))
- problem may be less the quantity of food than its quality, and in particular the shortage of micronutrients. The benefits of good nutrition may be particularly strong for two sets of people who do not decide what they eat: unborn babies and young children. ([Location 856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=856))
- There are even cheaper ways to avert diarrhea, such as adding chlorine to water. Other very inexpensive medical or public health technologies with proven effectiveness include ORS, getting children immunized, deworming drugs, exclusive breast-feeding until six months, and some routine antenatal procedures such as a tetanus shot for the expectant mother. Vitamin B against night blindness, iron pills and iron-fortified flour against anemia, and so on are other examples of low-hanging fruit. ([Location 990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=990))

- Across the developing world, we are seeing a rise in antibiotic resistance. Similarly, incorrect dosage and poor patient compliance explain the emergence, in several African countries, of strains of malaria parasites that are resistant to mainstream medications, which has the makings of a public health disaster. ([Location 1102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=1102))
- Private facilities offer the assurance that the doctor will be there. If he isn’t, he won’t get paid, whereas the absent government employee on a salary will. ([Location 1122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=1122))
- The low immunization rates, it was widely held, must have been the result of the delinquency of the nurses. Mothers would just get tired of walking all the way there with a young child and not finding the nurse. ([Location 1146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=1146))
- In fact, there is a “psychological sunk cost” effect—people are more likely to make use of something they have paid a lot for. In addition, people may judge quality by price: Things may be judged to be valueless precisely because they are cheap. ([Location 1161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=1161))
- Several studies that have tested whether people use things less because they got them for free found no evidence of such behavior. ([Location 1172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=1172))
- In the end, the mistrust of incentives for immunization comes down to an article of faith for both those on the right and the left of the mainstream political spectrum: Don’t try to bribe people to do things that you think they ought to do. For the right, this is because it will be wasted; for the conventional left, which includes much of the public health community and the good doctor from Seva Mandir, this is because it degrades both what is given and the person who gets it. Instead, we should focus on trying to convince the poor of the benefits of immunization. ([Location 1274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=1274))
- An important idea is that of default option: The government (or a well-meaning NGO) should make the option that it thinks is the best for most people the default choice, so that people will need to actively move away from it if they want to. So people have the right to choose what they want, but there is a small cost of doing so, and as a result, most people end up choosing the default option. ([Location 1314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=1314))
## New highlights: [[2025-03-18-Tuesday]] at 6:30 AM
- poverty is not just a lack of money; it is not having the capability to realize one’s full potential as a human being. ... Talking about the problems of the world without talking about some accessible solutions is the way to paralysis rather than progress. ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=305))
- Figure 1: The S-Shape Curve and the Poverty Trap ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=411))
- Even among the very poor, food expenditures increase much less than one for one with the budget. Equally remarkable, even the money that people spend on food is not spent to maximize the intake of calories or micronutrients. When very poor people get a chance to spend a little bit more on food, they don’t put everything into getting more calories. Instead, they buy better-tasting, more expensive calories. ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=549))
- In terms of calories per rupee, the millets (jowar and bajra) were clearly the best buy. Yet only about two-thirds of the total spending on grains was on these grains, while another 30 percent was spent on rice and wheat, which cost on average about twice as much per calorie. ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=553))
- So it is not that the lack of food could not be a problem or isn’t a problem from time to time, but the world we live in today is for the most part too rich for hunger to be a big part of the story of the persistence of poverty. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=633))
- We are often inclined to see the world of the poor as a land of missed opportunities and to wonder why they don’t put these purchases on hold and invest in what would really make their lives better. The poor, on the other hand, may well be more skeptical about supposed opportunities and the possibility of any radical change in their lives. They often behave as if they think that any change that is significant enough to be worth sacrificing for will simply take too long. This could explain why they focus on the here and now, on living their lives as pleasantly as possible, celebrating when occasion demands it. ([Location 804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=804))
- It is not that people don’t care about their health. They do, and they devote considerable resources to it. They just seem to spend money elsewhere: on antibiotics that are not always necessary, on surgery that comes too late to help. Why does it have to be this way? ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=869))
- The ladders to get out of the poverty trap exist but are not always in the right place, and people do not seem to know how to step onto them or even want to do so. ([Location 993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=993))
- This is particularly true if, as many of these doctors are wont to do to save their patients money, the advised course is shorter than the standard regimen. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=1058))

    - Note: are wont*
- Poor parents may even be fully convinced of the benefits of immunization—but these benefits will accrue sometime in the future, while the cost is incurred today. It makes sense, from today’s perspective, to wait for tomorrow. ([Location 1251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=1251))
    - Note: “Time Inconsistency”
- The poor seem to be trapped by the same kinds of problems that afflict the rest of us—lack of information, weak beliefs, and procrastination among them. ... Our real advantage comes from the many things that we take as given. We live in houses where clean water gets piped in—we do not need to remember to add Chlorin to the water supply every morning. The sewage goes away on its own—we do not actually know how. ... And perhaps most important, most of us do not have to worry where our next meal will come from. In other words, we rarely need to draw upon our limited endowment of self-control and decisiveness, while the poor are constantly being required to do so. We should recognize that no one is wise, patient, or knowledgeable enough to be fully responsible for making the right decisions for his or her own health. For the same reason that those who live in rich countries live a life surrounded by invisible nudges, the primary goal of health-care policy in poor countries should be to make it as easy as possible for the poor to obtain preventive care, ([Location 1304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=1304))
- The willingness to use words like “stupid” and “intelligent” to refer to one’s own children, often in their presence, is entirely consistent with a worldview that puts a large premium on picking a winner (and in getting everyone else in the family to back the winner). This belief creates a strange form of sibling rivalry. ([Location 1640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=1640))
- The curriculum and organization of schools often date back to a colonial past, when schools were meant to train a local elite to be the effective allies of the colonial state, and the goal was to maximize the distance between them and the rest of the populace. ([Location 1655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=1655))
- Recognizing that schools have to serve the students they do have, rather than the ones they perhaps would like to have, may be the first step to having a school system that gives a chance to every child. ([Location 1855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=1855))
- Yet most societies rely on the goodwill of the parents to make sure that children get fed, schooled, socialized, and taken care of more generally. Given that these are the same parents who contrive to let their little girls die, how much faith should we place in their ability to get this done effectively? ([Location 2210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=2210))
- It is, for example, now widely recognized that public support programs that put money in the hands of women, like the Mexican program PROGRESA, for example, may be much more effective in directing resources toward children. ([Location 2279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=2279))
- The most effective population policy might therefore be to make it unnecessary to have so many children (in particular, so many male children). Effective social safety nets (such as health insurance or old age pensions) or even the kind of financial development that enables people to profitably save for retirement could lead to a substantial reduction in fertility and perhaps also less discrimination against girls. ([Location 2301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=2301))
- A friend of ours from the world of high finance always says that the poor are like hedge-fund managers—they live with huge amounts of risk. The only difference is in their levels of income. In fact, he grossly understates the case: No hedge-fund manager is liable for 100 percent of his losses, unlike almost every small business owner and small farmer. Moreover, the poor often have to raise all of the capital for their businesses, either out of the accumulated “wealth” of their families or by borrowing from somewhere, a circumstance most hedge-fund managers never have to face. ([Location 2333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=2333))
- There is so much risk in the everyday lives of the poor that somewhat paradoxically, events that are perceived to be cataclysmic in rich countries often seem to barely register with them. In February 2009, the World Bank’s president, Robert Zoellick, warned the world’s leaders: “The global economic crisis [sparked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008] threatens to become a human crisis in many developing countries unless they can take targeted measures to protect vulnerable people in their communities. While much of the world is focused on bank rescues and stimulus packages, we should not forget that poor people in developing countries are far more exposed if their economies falter.” ([Location 2367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=2367))
- Facing risk (not only income risk but also the risk of death or disease) makes us worry, and worrying makes us stressed and depressed. Symptoms of depression are much more prevalent among the poor. Being stressed makes it harder to focus, which in turn may make us less productive. In particular, there is a strong association between poverty and the level of cortisol produced by the body, an indicator of stress. And conversely, the cortisol levels go down when households receive some help. ... This is important, because it turns out that cortisol directly impairs cognitive and decision-making ability. The stress-induced release of cortisol affects brain areas such as the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the hippocampus, which are important in cognitive functioning; in particular, the prefrontal cortex is important in suppression of impulsive responses. It is therefore no surprise that when experimental subjects are artificially put under stressful conditions in the laboratory, they are less likely to make the economically rational decision when faced with choosing among different alternatives. ([Location 2428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=2428))
- Within health care, insuring catastrophic health events—major illnesses, accidents—seems much easier than covering outpatient care. Nobody wants to have surgery or chemotherapy just for the heck of it, and the treatment is easily verified. The danger of overtreatment remains, but the insurer can cap what it will pay for each treatment. The big issue that remains is selection: The insurance company does not want only sick people signing up. To avoid adverse selection, the trick is to start from a large pool of people who came together for some other reason than health—employees of a large firm, microcredit clients, card-carrying Communists . . . and try to insure all of them. This is why many microfinance institutions (MFIs) thought of offering health insurance. They have a large pool of borrowers who could be offered insurance products. And because catastrophic health problems sometimes drive the otherwise highly compliant microcredit clients into default, health insurance for them would be a little bit of insurance for the MFI as well. ... But a voluntary product taken by only a few clients is again susceptible to adverse selection and moral hazard. ([Location 2582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=2582))
    - Note: Moral hazard & adverse selection are two of the biggest risks for insurance cos Moral hazard: start slacking off or unnecessarily go to the doc or not take care of health Adverse selection: only have people sign up that are likely to make a lot of claims (pre-existing issues)
- Private companies could continue to sell exactly the kinds of insurance they are currently willing to sell (catastrophic care with a strict cap, indexed weather insurance, and so forth). But for the time being, the government should pay a part of insurance premiums for the poor. There is already evidence that this could work: ... It is possible that over time, as people start to see how insurance works and the market starts to grow, the subsidy could be phased out. But even if that is not possible, given the enormous potential gains that could be achieved if the poor did not need to be the hedge-fund managers of their own lives, this seems like a great place to use public funds to promote the common good. ([Location 2667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=2667))
- Where MFIs clearly diverge from traditional moneylending is in removing almost all flexibility. Moneylenders will allow their borrowers to choose how they borrow and the way they repay—some repay once a week, but others repay whenever they have money in hand. Some repay only the interest until they are ready to repay the entire principal. An MFI client, by contrast, typically has to repay a fixed amount every week, starting one week after the loan is given out, and, at least for first loans, everyone usually receives the same amount. Moreover, the borrower has to make the payment at the weekly meeting, which is always at a fixed time for each group. ... This allows a loan officer to collect repayment from 100 to 200 people every day, whereas a moneylender has to wait around not knowing when the money is coming in. Moreover, since the transaction is so simple, the loan officer does not need to be particularly well educated or trained, which also keeps costs down. ... All of these innovations contribute to reducing the administrative costs of lending, which, as we argued above, get blown up by the multiplier effect and make lending to the poor so very expensive. ([Location 2845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=2845))
- In many ways, their success comes from making repayment an implicit social compact, in which the community ensures that loans will be repaid and the MFI continues to provide further loans. ([Location 2972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=2972))
    - Tags: #readwise/typo 
    - Note: compact -> contract
- But a social equilibrium based on the combination of collective responsibility and an ongoing relationship is necessarily somewhat fragile. If the two reasons I repay are that everyone is repaying and that I will get a new loan in the future, then whether I repay or not gets tied to what I believe about what everyone else is doing and the future of the organization. ([Location 2977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=2977))
    - Note: with respect to MFIs
- The microfinance model, as we saw, is simply not well designed to put large sums of money in the hands of people who might fail. This is not an accident, nor is this due to some shortcoming in the microcredit vision. It is the necessary by-product of the rules that have allowed microcredit to lend to a large number of poor people at low interest rates. ... Microfinance gives its clients every incentive to play it safe, so it is not well suited to discover who has an appetite for risk taking. ([Location 3017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=3017))
- Yet all the ingenuity the poor employ to save may simply be a symptom of the fact that they don’t have access to the more conventional and simpler alternatives. Banks don’t like managing small accounts, largely because of the administrative costs of running them. Deposit-taking institutions are heavily regulated, for good reason—the government is worried about fly-by-night operators running away with people’s savings—but this means that managing each account requires bank employees to fill out some amount of paperwork, which can quickly become too burdensome, relative to any money that the bank can hope to make from these tiny accounts. ([Location 3156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=3156))
- the human brain processes the present and the future very differently. In essence, we seem to have a vision of how we should act in the future that is often inconsistent with the way we act today and will act in the future. One form that this “time inconsistency” takes is to spend now, at the same time as we plan to save in the future. In other words, we hope that our “tomorrow’s self” will be more patient than “today’s self” is prepared to be. ([Location 3273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=3273))
- Awareness of our problems thus does not necessarily mean that they get solved. It may just mean that we are able to perfectly anticipate where we will fail. ([Location 3341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=3341))
- (You’ll never really save enough for that refrigerator, the voice in your ear insists. Have a cup of tea instead . . . ).The result is a vicious circle: Saving is less attractive for the poor, because for them the goal tends to be very far away, and they know that there will be lots of temptations along the way. But of course, if they do not save they remain poor. ([Location 3355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=3355))
- Microcredit, of course, is just one of many ways in which we can help the poor think in terms of a future where some of their long-term goals can become attainable. Better education for their children would probably have the same effect. So would a steady and secure job, a theme to which we will return in the next chapter. Or insurance against health or weather disasters, so that they don’t worry that any nest egg that they manage to accumulate will just get wiped out. Or even a social safety net: a minimum income support that people would be entitled to if their income fell below a certain range that would free them from having to worry about finding money to survive. The sense of security that any of these would provide would encourage savings for two reasons: by creating a sense that the future holds promises, and by lowering the stress level, which directly impedes decisionmaking ability. The bigger point is that a little bit of hope and some reassurance and comfort can be a powerful incentive. It is easy for those of us who have enough, living a secure life, structured by goals that we can reasonably confidently aspire to achieve (that new sofa, the 50-inch flat screen, that second car) and institutions designed to help us get there (savings accounts, pension programs, home-equity loans) to assume, like the Victorians, that motivation and discipline are intrinsic. As a result, there are always worries about being overindulgent to the slothful poor. Our contention is that for the most part, the problem is the opposite: It is too hard to stay motivated when everything you want looks impossibly far away. Moving the goalposts closer may be just what the poor need to start running toward them. ([Location 3417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=3417))
- This is the paradox of the poor and their businesses: They are energetic and resourceful and manage to make a lot out of very little. But most of this energy is spent on businesses that are too small and utterly undifferentiated from the many others around them. As a result, their operators have no chance to earn a reasonable living. The creative sand-driers of Mumbai had spotted an opportunity to make a profitable use of the resources available to them: some free time and the sand on the beach. But what the businessman’s uncle had failed to point out was that, for all their ingenuity, the profits from this activity were almost surely negligible. ([Location 3637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=3637))
- In the same way that the poor may save less than the middle class because they know that their savings will not be enough to reach a consumption goal they are really looking forward to, they may not invest as much (not only money but also emotions and intellectual energy) in their businesses because they already know that they can’t make a real difference. ([Location 3718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=3718))
- The enterprises of the poor often seem more a way to buy a job when a more conventional employment opportunity is not available than a reflection of a particular entrepreneurial urge. Many of the businesses are run because someone in the family has (or is believed to have) some time on hand and every little bit helps. ([Location 3753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=3753))
- Top-down monitoring is not a particularly new idea. But audits and decoys seem to be effective, presumably because once the information is out there, there is some chance that it will be used to punish the offenders. A few people within the system who believe in fighting corruption may be enough. ([Location 4080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=4080))
- So politics is not very different from policy: It can (and must) be improved at the margin, and seemingly minor interventions can make a significant difference. The same kind of philosophy we have advocated throughout this book—attend to the details, understand how people decide, and be willing to experiment—applies as much to politics as it does to everything else. ([Location 4207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=4207))
- The focus on the broad INSTITUTIONS as a necessary and sufficient condition for anything good to happen is somewhat misplaced. The political constraints are real, and they make it difficult to find big solutions to big problems. But there is considerable slack to improve institutions and policy at the margin. Careful understanding of the motivations and the constraints of everyone (poor people, civil servants, taxpayers, elected politicians, and so on) can lead to policies and institutions that are better designed, and less likely to be perverted by corruption or dereliction of duty. These changes will be incremental, but they will sustain and build on themselves. They can be the start of a quiet revolution. ([Location 4399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=4399))
- As this book has shown, although we have no magic bullets to eradicate poverty, no one-shot cure-all, we do know a number of things about how to improve the lives of the poor. In particular, five key lessons emerge. First, the poor often lack critical pieces of information and believe things that are not true. They are unsure about the benefits of immunizing children; they think there is little value in what is learned during the first few years of education; they don’t know how much fertilizer they need to use; ... Second, the poor bear responsibility for too many aspects of their lives. The richer you are, the more the “right” decisions are made for you. The poor have no piped water, and therefore do not benefit from the chlorine that the city government puts into the water supply. ... They have no automatic way to save, such as a retirement plan or a contribution to Social Security, so they have to find a way to make sure that they save. ... Third, there are good reasons that some markets are missing for the poor, or that the poor face unfavorable prices in them. ...
