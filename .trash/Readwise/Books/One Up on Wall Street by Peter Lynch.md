## Highlights
- as an investor, your goal should be to find a tenfold increaser (what he calls a tenbagger): a stock that makes you back 10 times what you invested. A tenfold increaser dramatically improves your return and helps erase the effect of a bad investment. You can find such companies anywhere and probably encounter two to three a year in daily life. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/10ae1bbe-f823-45a6-b705-dd5767a387af))
- any pundit or acquaintance who thinks they know how the market will perform is likely wrong: It’s virtually impossible to predict the market’s future movements accurately. Therefore, it doesn’t make sense to act based on the market ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/0b21e2a8-9837-4144-b2a6-a937492f6c8f))
- In The Intelligent Investor, Graham strongly recommends investing in dependable companies, which he describes as large, prominent companies with conservative financing. Graham clarifies that such a company should have at least $10 billion in market capitalization, be an industry leader, and have a market capitalization no greater than twice its value. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/006d1efe-6540-4d62-b7d8-8746eaa07e89))
- Fast-growth companies these days tend to be tech start-ups. Such companies are almost compelled to grow extremely aggressively because the first mover generally captures the entire market, making speed more important than careful planning. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/241a209a-6740-45ef-bc1f-03ef5dee898f))
- Hidden-treasure companies: These are companies that have an asset you happen to know about but which professional investors have overlooked. An asset might be cash, real estate, a subscription model, or some other hidden advantage. It takes inside knowledge to know this advantage. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/a5ae0c4a-acf5-4eb1-8fe5-a1724ddb1dd2))
- Lynch believes you’ll find the best investment opportunities in the places most familiar to you: daily life and work. Familiar companies are best to invest in because you have the greatest odds of understanding them and how well they’ll perform. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/4f1600b9-dc79-4792-af1e-45d6e48d1328))
- you must never buy stock in a company merely because you like its products. Instead, decide first if the stock is over- or undervalued and then buy or hold off accordingly. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/38981c2c-01c3-4370-b8a9-2ff2109012e7))
- Seek out companies in industries that seem not to be growing at all because this indicates there’s little competition in such industries, and strong companies can flourish. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/56638601-17dd-42c1-96fe-658c4db15001))
    - Note: Not sure about this but worth a try
- The P/E ratio is the stock Price to company Earnings ratio. You obtain this by dividing the company’s stock price by the company’s earnings per share ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/d3da5a56-831c-4bfa-a09b-5cf29be7f01b))
- Lynch writes that the P/E ratio is helpful for several reasons: You can think of it as the number of years it will take the company to earn back your initial investment. Therefore, a high P/E ratio (20 or 30, for instance) may be unattractive while a low one (say 6 or 7) may be attractive. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/14cb7c9b-56ee-45ca-9dce-4e7766457ed9))
- Another way to think about the P/E ratio is that it’s an indicator of what investors are willing to pay today for a stock based on its past earnings or projected future earnings. So if a company has a high P/E today, it might mean that investors expect the company to grow significantly in the future and are willing to pay a high share price now. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/d55dc2e3-26d2-4953-a2b4-8287a28022ef))
- You want to see that a company’s assets are growing and that its liabilities (debt) are shrinking over time. It’s also a good sign when the company’s assets are currently greater than its debt—if this is true, the company likely isn’t about to go out of business. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/a4b55b00-a005-4fb9-bbeb-ba5c6a2a1fd6))
- Is this company doing something no other company can easily do? What about this company’s business model, product, or operations can’t easily be duplicated and therefore makes the company valuable? If you have positive answers to the above questions, you can consider the company to have a special asset. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/ab2f5506-0d98-4e11-b343-f0a006235c66))
- the final step of assessing and researching a stock is to devise a two-minute monologue describing why the company’s worth investing in, which you can say to yourself or to someone else. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/d7d7e027-b48b-4b81-8021-56af87545241))
- If a company is garnering significant attention in the media, more investors will likely be drawn to the stock, which will drive the price up and eventually may cause it to collapse. You might thus consider selling just when you start reading about the company in the press ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/88aa15b5-08fb-4d10-b9ee-ad745e716ad0))
- buy as many stocks as you feel you have special knowledge in or which you’ve thoroughly researched and have faith in. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/45d67bf8-85df-44a6-ad53-67f31deb51be))
