## Highlights
- Angry people are often angry because they feel unheard. Once you sympathize with them, they will soften their anger substantially. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/6d113028-1ca7-4f84-903e-6e6b921048fb))
- A person’s name is the most important word in any language to them. Use it often and respect it. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/c89a1efb-2a65-403c-8da5-098e500839aa))
- Appeal to the other person’s interests. Virtually all people care more about what they want than what you want. 
  You wouldn’t go fishing with cheesecake as a lure, since fish don’t like cheesecake. Go fishing with worms.
  Keep asking yourself - “what is it that this person wants?” ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/7350fb0a-c828-4119-9ee1-a4d310681f99))
- People crave the feeling of importance. Make someone feel important and they will think well of you. Diminish someone’s importance and they will resent you. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/fdb9bf29-afc3-40ad-a314-f799a74e3d27))
- Control your temper. You can measure a person by what makes her angry. Little people get angry over little things. Big people are undisturbed and keep cool. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/76861d21-1b2c-4490-bd25-fd0e56530ef7))
- Understand that the other person has a valid view of the situation. If you were born as them with their brain and undergoing their experiences, you would by definition feel the same way they do. Your job is to understand what led them to believe what they believe. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/8ed12334-843d-42a4-8472-89ff370d7fcf))
- When ready, ask a series of questions that will lead them to your conclusion. Start with undeniable areas of agreement, then approach your ultimate point in terms they will agree with. This will make them feel they independently changed their mind. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/6050cb06-528a-4080-9b9a-e953faf67b66))
- The principles are best applied with sincerity. Be genuinely interested in other people and believe they have something to teach you. Be genuinely interested in helping others achieve their interests. Without this sincerity, you will feel disingenuous to others.
  Keep remembering how important these principles are to you. “My success depends on how I interact with people.” ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/14298321-8ced-485a-a6e3-39244d80d455))
- It may feel good to tell someone off, but this is usually harmful in the long term. People continue to justify their actions and condemn you for the criticism. People can harbor resentments for insults that last a literal lifetime. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/31a1b88b-a923-4f1b-b219-2244ea05a8e9))
- Criticism hurts a person’s pride and sense of importance.

- The only way to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it. Every person in the world knows what they want, and cares about what they get. Approach them from this direction. Appeal to their self-interest for doing anything. Arouse in them a hunger for what they want.
  The only way to get anyone to do anything is to make the other person want to do it. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/ab835e91-941d-46a4-a254-5f1cf1f1cf37))
- make people feel important by being happy to see them, encouraging them to discuss their interests and passions at length, calling them by their name, and giving genuine praise for things they pride themselves on. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/2fd7d1f0-49e5-4c31-8daf-edd16619b569))
- Showing interest in other people makes them feel important (Fundamental 2).
  All of us like people who admire us. If we think highly of ourselves, then we appreciate people who have good taste and judgment.
  People aren’t interested in you or me. They’re interested in themselves, every day, for their entire life. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/464b3729-896f-4e54-b6a3-8a23cf1a4202))
- Smile especially at people who are not used to be smiled at and just see frowns all day, like servicepeople. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/554fd766-3bdc-4d79-9da7-2d0c1f9c43d0))
- A name is a person’s identity. It makes her unique among all others. Remembering it and calling a person by it makes her feel important. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/47d240af-3e2f-4bba-a42e-37a4f4ef8d33))
- You can be a good conversationalist merely by 1) showing genuine, undivided interest, 2) getting the other person to talk. 
  You don’t even need to talk yourself, if the other person doesn’t invite you to. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/fe3f0355-0fc5-4c1d-ac1c-25f8cd326e9f))
- Before meeting someone, research their interests thoroughly so you have a working knowledge of the field. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/719398a7-3d29-4d3d-8620-1c90e617a2d4))
- “Here lies the body of William Jay, who died maintaining his right of way - He was right, dead right, as he sped along. But he’s just as dead as if he were wrong.” ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/8926b122-d89c-4850-84b1-bdcad7e843ac))

- Distrust your first instinctive impression. Be calm and watch out for your angry first reaction. Control your temper. You can measure the size of a person by what makes her angry. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/ee2de2e9-496c-421e-9ec1-3b90ae78fe37))
- When asking for something, don’t complain about how unreasonable the situation is. Talk about what you appreciate so much and how the current situation will prevent you from enjoying the appreciation further. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/b57d9b7f-b07a-41cc-88cf-ea8b347e8537))
- An engineering supervisor presented to management her new system of running yarn, highlighting how it was superior and how she had all the answers they needed. It failed - management wasn’t given a way to admit their current system’s failures and they became defensive. In the next session, she changed her approach - she asked what their problems were and for their opinions on how to fix it. This paved the way for her solution. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/0daa0d4a-f281-4ee6-9c45-7be5cbbc2fe7))
- If someone criticizes your work, be gracious. “To be honest, I don’t entirely agree with it myself. Not everything I write yesterday appeals to me today. I’m glad to learn what you think about this.” ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/3db18616-00dd-48aa-af57-8d8f0f332519))
- If you’ve had an argument where each person seemed to be repeating the same points over and over, it might be because she didn’t feel acknowledged ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/7f953097-0b4a-4f03-8b11-011df98b2a18))
- There is a reason the other person thinks and acts as she does. Discover that reason, and you have the key to influencing this person. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/d2362d12-8f22-48ef-9586-24bf0a6d313d))
- The majority of people are hungering for sympathy. Being pitied makes someone feel important, since other people are paying attention to them. Give it to them, and they will love you. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/fa6de4bb-d525-4a69-8dcf-904bbdfcf462))
- People like their own ideas better than other people’s. Coming up with their own ideas makes them feel smart and important. Executing their own ideas, instead of someone else’s, gives them agency.
  Isn’t it a bad idea, then, to ram your ideas down someone else’s throat? Isn’t it better to let people think through to your conclusion? ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/86ac4788-0877-4c96-bbfd-9b16701a88cd))
- If you want to improve something about a person, act as though that trait were already one of her outstanding characteristics. They will try to live up to that reputation, rather than disappoint you and betray their image. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/7cc6f3b5-4e6f-4f81-ba77-8be2e6ebf756))

  People want to feel important. Being valued for certain traits or their reputation makes them feel important, and they will work to continue feeling important. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/8eb0d321-0015-4112-b9f6-12b15ccca1c3))
- Ask yourself what it is the other person really wants. Then consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/771bc2fd-14e2-4924-b3a9-937238759ca4))
