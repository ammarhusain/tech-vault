## Highlights
- A Platonist thinks appearance is but a bad copy of real reality.
  While an Aristotelian puts all his faith in its observation!
  Are mental concepts innate or acquired?
  "Innate" says the great Kant, "Acquired" says the great Hume!
  Is there an opposition between mind and matter?
  Yes, says Descartes. No, says Spinoza! (Page 92)
- A tautology is a statement which is necessarily true by virtue of its logical form, as in 'all red ants are red'. (Page 97)
- Henri Poincare, the great French genius, a strong believer in the importance of human intuition.
  David Hilbert, no less great, the German apostle of the rigorous exactness of logical proof. (Page 145)
- From the time of the Greeks, mathematicians had looked at individual objects, such as: a shape, a number, a function.
  But in the mid 19th century, a Czech mathematician started looking instead at collections of objects, defined by a common property. For example "all numbers greater than 7", "all trignometric functions". From this simple everyday notion Georg Cantor developed the majestic, wondrous edifice of Set Theory. (Page 146)
- Hibert's much expected talk on "the Problems of Mathematics: His stated aim was to give a bird's eye view of the future, by way of twenty three major unsolved problems. Yet, his speech was above all a plea for a new mentality, which annulled a host of existing preconceptions (Rigorous proof: intuition shall no more have place in our proofs). 
  Some of "Hilbert's Problems" of 1900 keep mathematicians busy even today. (Page 150)
- Russell's (Barber) paradox : "Those who don't shave themselves are shaved by the barber"
  When something refers to itself, paradox is nearby (self-referential systems). (Page 164)
- Bertrand Russell - I've said that the Foundations of Mathematics were like a mythical turtle supporting the Cosmos. Yet, all we did when we tried to create solid ground for the beast to stand on, was a "tower of turtles all the way down"! (Page 189)
- A new found sense of responsibility showed me a way out of my despair. An occasion for a surprising new outreach to life. 
  The tragic loneliness of every human being, the finiteness and profound futility of life, the terrible harshness of pain & disease, the unmitigated horror of death - there is also an alternative : redemption, in compassion, in love. (Page 234)
- Schopenhauer : there is nothing like a good near-death experience, to humanize you! (Page 245)
- The meaning of the world does not reside in the world (Page 250)
- Put a man on the brink of the abyss and - in the unlikely event that he doesn't fall into it - he will become either a mystic or a madman. Which is probably the same thing! (Page 251)
