## Highlights
- Four Foundation Behaviors:
  1. Demonstrate Respect
  2. Listen first
  3. Clarify expectations
  4. Practice accountability
  People + Process = Success
- Five stages of project management: Initiate, Plan, Execute, Monitor/control & close.
- Initiate Mindset: You must clarify a shared & measurable set of expectations
  We lack the map, the landmark, the milestones - all the things that keep us on track. So instead we and our projects go around in circles. Because we aren't clear on expectations, we act like we're blindfolded. With only a general idea of which direction to go, we end up 'circling back' - doing extra work, second guessing or getting smothered by 'scope creep'.
- - Who will this project impact?
  - Who determines success & what are their expectations?
  - What are the project limitations?
  - How do you create a shared understanding of the project outcomes?
- The more information you start with, the less uncertainty you'll experience down the road.
  Words are only code for the pictures in our minds.
- Interview questions:
  **Purpose**:
  Why are you doing this? How does this affect the goals of the org?
  **Description**:
  The what, how & the when of the project. 'Could you tell me what that means to you or what it would look like?'. 'So here is what I heard you say ... did I get that exactly right?'
  **Desired results:**
  What are the specific measures & outcomes that must be accomplished?
  **Exclusions**:
  Considerations or elements that will not be part of the project.
  **Acceptance or Exit Criteria:**
  Who the ultimate decision makers are and what they would like to see for a sign off. 'How do you define success on this project?'
  Nail down your acceptance criteria!
- Manage the project or task, don't get bogged down managing the tools.
- You must model the behavior you want from others, consistently. You must keep 100% of your commitments. You'll inspire people when you hold them accountable, and you'll earn more respect.
- Anything that can be changed, will be changed until there is no time left to change anything.
- Identify scope creep: What is the intent of the change? What is the impact? What would be required to make the change happen?
- 'When we have no control over a problem, our responsibility is to smile, to genuinely and peacefully accept the problem and learn to live with it, even if we don't like it. In this way we do not empower the problem to control us.': Stephen Covey.
- If there is one overarching principle to successful project management, it has to be the mastery of informal authority. Learning how to lead with the Four foundational behaviors will be key to your success.
