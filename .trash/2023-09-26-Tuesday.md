# TOP-OF-MIND
- Leo Keselman:
	- Computer vision work at CMU
	- Intel RealSense
	- Interesting in little bit research & little engineering - want to build products
	- everyone on team had a PhD, deeper technical skills - learn are tehre better ways to formulate this?
	- TAed CS231n at Stanford - lot of NN work there
	- Avoided using NN at CMU
	- Familiar with ViT, SAM etc, transformer based architectures - not super familiar with YOLO like architectures
	- Most of language work was at stanford - word2vec, glove etc
	- Downloaded & ran Llama 
	- Most of robotics is doing simple stuff
	- Code as Policies is very effective - LLM generated code and uses robotics APIs
	- Difficult to engage with works like RT-2 - massive amounts of data collection
	- Learning should be in the visual system of robotics
	- I dont like the tone they take at RT-2: they just combined multiple components
	- Better approach is to use diffusion models to generate trajectories
	- We have very good DETR style detectors (prompt engineered) - open vocabularies.
	- Ambiguous user command -> LLM -> structured inputs to DETR for objects to detect
	- Dont know much about manipulation - still had strong opinion on RT-2 like approach
	- Dont really know how to connect the detection problem to what to pick up - building core robot skills to deploy
	- Really wants a not end-to-end structure with pre defined motion-object pairwise policies
	- Human preferences are valuable - mostly focussed on annotation less on the in-product use case.

# TASKS
```dataviewjs
const date = `${dv.current().file.name}`
const query1 = `(has happens date) OR (has due date) OR (has scheduled date) OR (has done date)`
const query2 = `(done on ` + date + `) OR (due on ` + date + `) OR (scheduled on ` + date + `) OR (happens on ` + date + `)`
dv.paragraph('```tasks\n ' + query1 + '\n' + query2 + '\n```');
```
# VAULT UPDATES
## NOTES CREATED IN THE LAST WEEK
``` dataview
TABLE file.folder AS Folder, file.ctime As Created
WHERE file.ctime >= date(substring(this.file.name,0,10)) - dur(1 week) AND file.ctime < date(substring(this.file.name,0,10))
SORT file.mtime ASCENDING
```

## NOTES MODIFIED IN THE LAST WEEK
``` dataview
TABLE file.folder AS Folder, file.mtime AS Modified, file.ctime AS Created
WHERE file.mtime >= date(substring(this.file.name,0,10)) - dur(1 week)
AND file.mtime < date(substring(this.file.name,0,10))
AND file.ctime < date(substring(this.file.name,0,10)) - dur(1 week)
SORT file.mtime ASCENDING
