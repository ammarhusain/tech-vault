  

First dive was air and then all nitrox after with EANx range between 28-30

Saturday 

Dive 1 : 6 kg

- Poseidons Garden - check dive
- Thistlegorm night dive : lots of lion fish, crocodile fish, cool jelly fish, 

Sunday

- thistlegorm : wreck back side, saw ammunition and propellers, 1 lion fish
- Thistlegorm: went into the second and first floor cargo cabins, saw motorcycles, cars, radiators, so much cool stuff… was fully loaded when it sank by German air bombardment. Was initially apprehensive going into the cabins but was one of the coolest dives I’ve ever done in my life.

  

- Ras Mohamed: coral reef with a drop off wall that is more than 500m deep. Beautiful corals and reef fish. Saw many Tuna. Was quite underweight- started floating towards the end as my tank emptied out. Husain gave me a kg in my hand to help sink down a bit. I sucked up a lot of air trying to get down because of that - had to end dive around 45 mins because of me. Yolanda and shark reef.

  

  

  

- Tiran Lagoon : night dive, there was a bit of bioluminescence but only very little. Saw an eel swim by which was super cool to see. Easy dive sandy bottom and stayed pretty shallow. Dive master and buddy was Ashraf. Struggled with buoyancy during the safety stop again. 

  

Monday

- Tiran : Jackson reef, there was a bit of current. Beautiful coral wall. Messed up my buoyancy towards the end when Michael and Hussain pulled me down from 5 to 10m. Had air stuck in my BCD. The bungee on the wing hose is making it hard to pull it up and press the release button. I needed to pull the back release cord while swimming down.

  

- Tiran: Gordon reef - beautiful coral field. Super easy dive. My buoyancy and air consumption was on point - one of my calmest dives ever and probably the longest too. Saw a few puffer fish and two spotted rays. Some very large Gorgonians too

  

- Ras Mohamed : Anemon reef -> shark reef -> Yolanda reef : drift dive ; saw a turtle , 2 eels, lots of clown fish and the coral hair (aka anemon) which was beautiful. Crossing from anemon reef to Yolanda reef was like going through an abyss very deep ridge 

  

- night dive - Shawn Mahmoud: saw a bunch of eels, lion fish etc. Buoyancy was fine but made a bunch of stupid errors that threw me off. Didn’t wear mask jumping in the water, then flashlight died 10 mins into the dive, then lost GoPro that thankfully Tobi recovered. Overall dive was fine but I need to be mindful and extra careful 

  

  

Tuesday

- Dunraven : Shuab Mahmood 

- Carnatic : Sha’ab Abu Nu Has - dotted blue ray, schools of glass fish, pipe fish

  

- Ghiannis D : Sha’ab Abu Nu Has - beautiful ship wreck, probably my second favorite after Thistlegorm. Diving technique was pretty good overall - struggle to get back on to zodiac after the dive in the swell. I should also really start looking around more to appreciate my surroundings and get a full picture of the ship wreck scene. I find myself too zoomed on individual corals and fish rather than build full spatial awareness and scene reconstruction. Saw a scorpion fish, school of glass fish

  

- night dive - Dolphin House  - just swam around the boat for 45 mins or so going into the channel and back : saw eel, little shrimp, several hermit crabs, 

  

Wednesday

- Dolphinhouse Shaab el Erg : easy dive pretty shallow. Got dropped off by zodiac and then swam back to the boat. There was one coral that had an Octopus, a clown fish on anemon, lion fish and spider shrimp. No dolphins though :(
- Umm Gamar - fun and easy dive. Was quite packed with a lot of divers from other boats too. Went into a small cave at 25m which was quite cool.  

Nitrox

79 nitrogen, 21% oxygen in regular air

Nitrox has higher oxygen percent up to a max of 40%

Increases your no deco or no stop time up to a certain depth than regular air - extends your allowable bottom time

  

  

Body absorbs less nitrogen so less risk of bubble formation since body absorbs the oxygen

Narcosis might be the same at depth with nitrox and regular air as both nitrogen and oxygen can cause it ( drunkenness)

  

Gear

- Excess oxygen in the tank can cause oxidation reactions on your gear. Oxygen >40% requires special gear with specialized lubricants, o ring etc. Certain materials like oils and lubricants can cause fire or explosion when in contact with pure oxygen
- Partial pressure blending is one technique of filling in nitrox. It starts with filling the cylinder with pure oxygen first and then adding air to it to get the target EANx oxygen percent for the tank.
- Partial pressure blending is getting phased out in favor of other blending methods like using a membrane to separate nitrogen and oxygen.
- EANx30 means a tank with 30% oxygen
- Service gear once a year when diving with nitrox 
- EANx32 (nitrox 1) and EANx36 (nitrox 2) are the most common blends

  

Oxygen Toxicity

- oxygen partial pressure PO2 is simply the percent of oxygen in the enriched air tank and the pressure at depth. 
- At 10m the pressure is 2 bar: one from atmosphere and one bar from 10m water. So with EANx40 the partial pressure PO2 is 0.4 x 2  = 0.8
- Maximum oxygen partial pressure for enriched air diving is 1.4 bar/ata. Contingency limit is 1.6. Dives beyond this limit can cause oxygen toxicity

  

  

- Central nervous system CNS convulsions may occur if affected by oxygen toxicity. These can occur without warning and may cause diver to lose regulator and drown

  

Diving at altitude reduces your no stop time. Nitrox can help extend it but it’s not a definitive strategy

Any nitrox based emergency such as convulsions should be handled exactly the same as any other emergency- bring diver to surface ASAP, adjuster CPR if needed, give 100% oxygen, contact EMS. In case of convulsions it may at times be better to hold the regulator in their mouth until the convulsions subside and then bring them up.

Meditations:

- You do end up wearing the same thing over and over while traveling because that feels comfortable - stick to it. Sam as Brazil I loved the blue linen pants and the black Vince T-shirts. No point experimenting with too many clothes. Just stick to your comfort wear and you’ll be happy. Do not over pack as if you do not wear it at home then you will definitely not wear it while traveling. Only carry what you enjoy wearing in SF
- Get some linen trousers and shirts (lose fitting for travel). Tight fit makes you look small and you will be conscious and uncomfortable 
- Do not buy stuff at flea markets - you just get ripped off and the haggling is very annoying. Go to some local neighbor stores instead where locals would go to shop. If they are pestering you then their stuff is not worth it.
