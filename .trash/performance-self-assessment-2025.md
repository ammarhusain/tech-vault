# Performance Self-Assessment

## What were your key achievements this year?

### Results
**Bubbles Integration & Performance Optimization**
- Pivoted quickly to help with critical Bubbles integration challenges, creating comprehensive analysis tools including latency plots and response discrepancy visualizations that paved the way for successful TTS migration
- Built the "Bubbles Weather Report" dashboard before proper infrastructure was in place, using intuition to identify key metrics that later became essential for the team
- My latency analysis work was specifically recognized by leadership (Saari) and contributed to roadshow success

**AttentionLLM: From Research to On-Device Deployment**
- Successfully fine-tuned and deployed AttentionLLM as a drop-in replacement, achieving impressive on-device performance (17.5-41 tokens/sec on iPhone 15)
- Built complete MVP integrating Motif Audio, Swift tools, conversation summarization, and MotifTools visualization
- Created live demo system that showcased real-time attention scoring capabilities to the organization

**Infrastructure & Developer Experience**
- Set up critical team infrastructure including CometML with AppleConnect SSO, automated dashboard updates, and rsync pipelines
- Identified and debugged complex issues including VAD triggering delays and duplicate LLM calls that were impacting system performance
- Discovered and confirmed tokenizer bug in llama.cpp affecting TinyLlama model performance

### Innovation
**Pioneering Multimodal AI for Robotics**
- Designed and prototyped photographer experience using Vision/Language Models, demonstrating novel use cases for embodied AI
- Built behavior tree engine with LLM generation capabilities for action sequencing, creating synthetic datasets for fine-tuning
- Developed working prototype for conversational memory using OpenAI Realtime API, establishing foundation for persistent agent memory

**Technical Innovation in Model Deployment**
- Achieved efficient on-device model deployment using 4-bit quantization and LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning techniques
- Created comprehensive evaluation frameworks for attention models that enabled data-driven improvements
- Integrated ML models with device perception systems (Motif, EntityKit) enabling real-time multimodal experiences

### Teamwork
**Cross-functional Collaboration**
- Successfully led Memories architecture meetings with cross-functional team (Saari, Anton, Xin, Sri), establishing clear work division
- Worked closely with Marios & Teddy on performance improvements, sharing insights that benefited the entire team
- Navigated organizational challenges to establish clear project ownership for AttentionLLM, preventing scope creep

**Knowledge Sharing & Mentorship**
- Documented complex technical issues and solutions, helping team members debug similar problems
- Created intuitive dashboards and visualization tools that made complex data accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- Shared learnings from side projects (AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Auth0) that later proved valuable for team infrastructure

## What capabilities have you focused on building over the past year?

**Technical Depth in ML/AI Systems**
- Deepened expertise in LLM fine-tuning, deployment, and optimization for edge devices
- Built proficiency in multimodal AI systems, integrating vision, language, and audio modalities
- Developed strong skills in ML infrastructure, from model training pipelines to production deployment

**Systems Thinking & Architecture**
- Enhanced ability to design end-to-end systems, from perception to action generation
- Improved skills in identifying performance bottlenecks and creating data-driven solutions
- Developed intuition for building developer tools and dashboards that address real team needs

**Entrepreneurial & Innovation Mindset**
- Explored AI data licensing startup (Crawlspace), building MVP and learning modern web stack
- Demonstrated ability to identify opportunities and rapidly prototype solutions
- Applied learnings from side projects to enhance team capabilities and infrastructure

**Leadership & Communication**
- Grew confidence in defending technical decisions and project scope in organizational meetings
- Improved ability to translate complex technical concepts into actionable insights for stakeholders
- Developed skills in leading technical discussions and driving consensus across teams

## Looking Forward
I'm excited to continue pushing the boundaries of on-device AI for robotics applications. My focus on performance optimization, multimodal integration, and developer experience has positioned me to take on larger technical challenges and contribute to the team's ambitious goals for the coming year.
