# Self-Assessment

## Accomplishments

### Teamwork
**Strengthened cross-functional collaboration during critical transitions**
- When the team faced integration challenges with Bubbles, I quickly pivoted from my planned work to provide analytical support. Working closely with Marios and Teddy, I created visualization tools that helped the team understand performance bottlenecks, directly contributing to successful TTS migration.
- Demonstrated leadership flexibility by voluntarily expanding my scope to include Memories development alongside Action Sequencing and Attention, enabling the team to maintain momentum across all three critical M0 pillars during resource constraints.
- Partnered effectively with OpenAI and Apple's internal ML liaisons, providing meticulously documented artifacts of audio garbling, text-audio mismatches, and silent token issues that accelerated resolution of critical model defects affecting our roadshow.

### Innovation  
**Pioneered on-device AI capabilities for next-generation experiences**
- Developed and deployed AttentionLLM as a drop-in replacement, achieving 17.5-41 tokens/sec on J310 — a 3x improvement over baseline performance through quantization optimizations.
- Created the Bubbles Weather Report dashboard using intuition about critical metrics before formal requirements existed. This proactive approach identified initial latency patterns that became key performance indicators for the roadshow.
- Built first working prototype of conversational memory using OpenAI Realtime API, demonstrating feasibility of persistent agent memory.
- Engineered innovative debugging methodology by creating J595-agnostic sandbox environments using OpenAI's Realtime API, which enabled controlled reproduction of roadshow failures in isolation. This approach definitively proved that critical demo failures (audio garbling, silent tokens, text mismatches) originated from model limitations rather than our infrastructure — a finding that fundamentally redirected our technical strategy and saved weeks of misdirected debugging efforts.
- Developed comparative analysis framework using Google's Gemini Realtime API to benchmark against frontier models, implementing roadshow-equivalent scenarios that revealed even state-of-the-art models exhibited similar conversational and tool-calling limitations as Bubbles. This validation provided critical confidence in our technical direction and tempered unrealistic expectations about switching to external models.
- Architected and prototyped Task Planning Agent that bridges natural language intents to executable robot behaviors, creating a novel approach for dynamic behavior generation that would be impossible to hand-code. Designed complete technical stack from intent parsing through behavior tree generation, validation, and integration with CharacterInteractionKit and EntityKit APIs.
- Demonstrated technical vision by proposing comprehensive development strategy leveraging model distillation from frontier reasoning models followed by post-training in simulation environments with RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards). This approach targets <2 second response times for on-device task planning while maintaining the reasoning capabilities of much larger models.

### Results
**Delivered measurable improvements in system performance and developer velocity**
- Developed suite of analytical tools that became essential infrastructure for the team's success:
  - Silent audio token detector with visualization capabilities that identified previously undetected model failures affecting 15% of responses
  - Bubbles Response Analysis Dashboard (http://j595-attention.corp.apple.com:8501/) that computed audio-text similarity scores and became the team's primary diagnostic tool for triaging issues
  - Response latency visualization system comparing text vs audio streams, providing data-driven confidence for TTS pivot decision that saved the roadshow
- These tools collectively reduced issue diagnosis time from hours to minutes and were adopted across the broader J595 organization for quality assurance.
- Architected and executed complete model migration of AttentionLLM from SmolLM decoder architecture to state-of-the-art ModernBERT encoder model, achieving 8x performance improvement while maintaining quality parity on internal evaluations. This complex migration required redesigning the entire prompt structure and training a custom classifier head using synthetic datasets I generated. Integration into the main M0 build is currently underway.


## Growth

**Technical Leadership**
- Evolved from individual contributor to technical lead across multiple critical M0 initiatives (AttentionLLM, Memories, Task Planning). Learned to balance technical depth with strategic thinking, successfully defending project scope while maintaining flexibility to support team needs during resource constraints.
- Developed ability to influence technical direction through data-driven insights rather than just opinions. My debugging methodologies and performance analyses became trusted decision-making tools, with leadership explicitly relying on my findings to make pivotal technical choices like the TTS migration.

**Systems Thinking & Infrastructure**
- Grew ability to anticipate infrastructure needs, exemplified by creating Bubbles dashboards before formal requirements. This proactive mindset shift resulted from studying successful internal tools and understanding demo pain points.
- Improved at translating complex technical concepts for stakeholders — roadshow retrospective specifically highlighted my latency visualizations as "most accessible technical content."

**Technical Versatility**
- Expanded skillset from pure ML research to full-stack deployment, mastering Docker containerization, AWS services, and edge computing optimizations through hands-on project work.

## Goals for Next Year

Deliver production-ready on-device AI capabilities and deepen technical expertise in embodied AI
- Develop and deploy transformer-based models for Attention and Task Planning optimized for Proto1 devices, targeting minimal inference latency while maintaining quality benchmarks. Focus on model architectures that balance performance with power constraints unique to J595 hardware.
- Lead migration from external APIs to Apple foundation models, establishing fine-tuning pipelines and evaluation frameworks that ensure seamless transition for complete technical stack readiness for product integration.
- Master reinforcement learning techniques for robotic control, applying RLVR approaches to improve action sequencing accuracy by 30%.

**Expand technical leadership and product ownership**
- Take on as DRI of 1-2 product areas by actively gathering requirements from HI team, translating user needs into technical specifications, and driving end-to-end delivery. Establish regular touchpoints with design partners to ensure technical solutions align with user experience goals.
- Build cross-functional influence by leading technical reviews, mentoring junior engineers on ML deployment, and establishing best practices for on-device AI development across the organization.

## Development Priorities

**Areas for Growth**
- **Strategic thinking**: While strong in technical execution, I need to better connect individual projects to broader product vision. Observed gap when defending AttentionLLM scope — focused on technical merits rather than strategic alignment.
- **External visibility**: My contributions often go unnoticed beyond immediate team. Need to improve at showcasing work through weekly demos and presentations.

**Development Actions**
- Schedule monthly 1:1s with product leadership to better understand strategic priorities and align technical decisions.
- Present work at weekly demos at least once every couple of months.
- Seek mentorship from 1-2 seasoned Apple engineers on translating technical excellence into organizational influence.
- Attend 1-2 conferences every year to keep current with advances in academia and industry

- **Identifying critical system gaps** through his systems thinking approach. Martin has consistently found gaps in our system as it relates to holistic decision making, ensuring we address fundamental issues rather than just surface-level problems.

- **Inspiring the team to stay product-focused** by constantly asking the hard questions about whether our work contributes to shipping. This keeps everyone grounded in practical outcomes rather than getting lost in technical exploration for its own sake.

Martin's influence extends beyond individual contributions - he shapes how the entire team thinks about prioritization and product delivery, ensuring our technical excellence serves real user needs.

### I'd like to see this team member focus more on…

**Teamwork: Cultivating relationships and working collaboratively**

**Teamwork: Providing leadership and inspiration to others**

**Why did you suggest this focus area? Provide examples:**

While Martin's laser focus on shipping a product is valuable, it can sometimes come across as challenging the assumptions or work of certain projects. Although he inquires out of genuine curiosity and good intent, this isn't always perceived that way by stakeholders.

Martin could work more to foster relationships with stakeholders and frame his questions with explicit curiosity rather than appearing to challenge. Building stronger collaborative relationships would amplify his already excellent product instincts and make his valuable insights more readily accepted.

Additionally, while Martin has excellent ideas, he can occasionally get bogged down in technical weeds when his natural place to lead and understand is from an architectural perspective, given his role as a manager. Staying at the right level of abstraction would help him be more effective in guiding technical direction while empowering his team to own the implementation details. 

## Jakub
### I'd like to see this team member continue...

**Innovation: Focusing on details that produce excellence**

Jakub has demonstrated exceptional attention to architectural details in his work on Action Sequencing and Arbitration, elevating the technical quality of our entire M0 effort. His meticulous approach ensures not just functional solutions, but elegant ones that scale. Importantly, Jakub consistently tries to do the right thing from the start, pushing for good code quality, bug reproducibility, and testability right in the system design phase.

**What was the positive impact? Provide examples:**

Jakub's work on Attention and Arbitration architecture has been instrumental in establishing a solid foundation for J595's behavior system. He has:

- **Led architecture review discussions** with diverse stakeholders, ensuring all perspectives were integrated through thorough preparation and clear documentation.

- **Secured cross-functional buy-in** by translating complex arbitration logic into understandable concepts, aligning everyone from experience to algs developers.

- **Prevented future technical debt** by anticipating edge cases and defining clear interfaces, while consistently advocating for existing solutions over reinvention. A prime example is his push for WorldState Collator and Active Context efforts to use EntityKit rather than building custom solutions from scratch.

The impact extends beyond implementation — Jakub has established patterns that raise the bar for architectural rigor across J595, saving countless hours through his "get it right the first time" approach.

I encourage Jakub to continue this focus on excellence and building systems thoughtfully from the ground up rather than accumulate technical debt that is harder to debug or fix for critical demos.

### I'd like to see this team member focus more on…

**Results: Producing high-quality outcomes**

**Why did you suggest this focus area? Provide examples:**

While Jakub's thoroughness is generally a strength, he sometimes gets bogged down by technical smoke & mirrors that other teams might put up. This can derail his own progress as he seeks clarification on how everything fits together, spending considerable time in discussions trying to understand complex or unclear explanations from other teams.

It would be more productive for Jakub to show progress through implementation rather than getting caught in endless talking cycles to achieve alignment and agreement. Sometimes the best way to clarify architectural questions is through working code and concrete examples, which can cut through ambiguous technical discussions more effectively than prolonged meetings.

## Madison
### I'd like to see this team member continue...

**Results: Accomplishing goals and objectives on time**

**Results: Enriching the customer experience**

**Results: Producing high-quality outcomes**

Madison consistently delivers great results through her technical work and customer-focused mindset. Her commitment to quality while meeting deadlines has strengthened the attention feature set and elevated the usage experience.

- **Excellence in bug triage and resolution** - Madison did a very good job triaging and fixing attention bugs for roadshow, ensuring that critical demos functioned properly. Her methodical approach to identifying, prioritizing, and resolving issues was instrumental in meeting our roadshow deadlines with high-quality experiences.

- **Advocating for enhanced customer experiences** - She went above and beyond by pitching directly to Kevin the need for shared attention and conversational context, which was not directly part of the demo script. This advocacy made Kevin realize the rich feature set of attention and enhanced the overall customer experience by demonstrating more natural, contextually-aware interactions.

### I'd like to see this team member focus more on…

**Teamwork: Positively influencing the performance of the team**

**Innovation: Applying expertise to find better ways to do things**

**Innovation: Taking smart, courageous risks**

**Why did you suggest this focus area? Provide examples:**

Madison excels at requirement gathering and stakeholder management, but could benefit from taking more calculated risks in implementation approach. When teams are far apart on direction or requirements, Madison could work on prototyping features and demonstrating them to the team rather than spending too much time getting consensus. A show-rather-than-tell approach would accelerate decision-making and provide concrete examples for stakeholder discussions.

By building quick prototypes that demonstrate her vision, Madison could more effectively influence both her team and cross-functional partners. This approach would leverage her strengths while helping break through communication barriers that sometimes arise in complex technical discussions.

This shift would also encourage greater innovation by allowing Madison to experiment with novel approaches before full alignment is reached, potentially discovering solutions that wouldn't emerge from discussion alone. Taking these smart, courageous risks to demonstrate ideas tangibly would complement her already strong requirements-gathering skills and potentially unlock new paths forward when discussions reach an impasse.
