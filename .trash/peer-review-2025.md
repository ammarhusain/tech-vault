# Peer Review - Jakub

## I'd like to see this team member continue...

**Innovation: Focusing on details that produce excellence**

Jakub has demonstrated exceptional attention to architectural details in his work on Action Sequencing and Arbitration, elevating the technical quality of our entire M0 effort. His meticulous approach ensures not just functional solutions, but elegant ones that scale. Importantly, Jakub consistently tries to do the right thing from the start, pushing for good code quality, bug reproducibility, and testability right in the system design phase.

**What was the positive impact? Provide examples:**

Jakub's work on Attention and Arbitration architecture has been instrumental in establishing a solid foundation for J595's behavior system. He has:

- **Led architecture review discussions** with diverse stakeholders, ensuring all perspectives were integrated through thorough preparation and clear documentation.

- **Secured cross-functional buy-in** by translating complex arbitration logic into understandable concepts, aligning everyone from experience to algs developers.

- **Prevented future technical debt** by anticipating edge cases and defining clear interfaces, while consistently advocating for existing solutions over reinvention. A prime example is his push for WorldState Collator and Active Context efforts to use EntityKit rather than building custom solutions from scratch.

The impact extends beyond implementation — Jakub has established patterns that raise the bar for architectural rigor across J595, saving countless hours through his "get it right the first time" approach.

I encourage Jakub to continue this focus on excellence and building systems thoughtfully from the ground up rather than accumulate technical debt that is harder to debug or fix for critical demos.

## I'd like to see this team member focus more on…

**Results: Producing high-quality outcomes**

**Why did you suggest this focus area? Provide examples:**

While Jakub's thoroughness is generally a strength, he sometimes gets bogged down by technical smoke & mirrors that other teams might put up. This can derail his own progress as he seeks clarification on how everything fits together, spending considerable time in discussions trying to understand complex or unclear explanations from other teams.

It would be more productive for Jakub to show progress through implementation rather than getting caught in endless talking cycles to achieve alignment and agreement. Sometimes the best way to clarify architectural questions is through working code and concrete examples, which can cut through ambiguous technical discussions more effectively than prolonged meetings.
