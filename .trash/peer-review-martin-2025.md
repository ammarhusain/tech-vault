# Peer Review - Martin

## I'd like to see this team member continue...

**Teamwork: Positively influencing the performance of the team**

**Teamwork: Providing leadership and inspiration to others**

**Innovation: Taking smart, courageous risks**

Martin consistently fights the good fight for the right things, always keeping the team focused on shipping a product. He has the courage to question whether the projects we're working on or proposing actually serve that end goal, preventing the team from getting sidetracked by interesting but non-essential work.

**What was the positive impact? Provide examples:**

Martin's product-focused leadership and systems thinking have been instrumental in keeping his team and adjacent ones on track toward meaningful outcomes. His impact includes:

- **Driving complexity reduction** across the system while being a strong proponent of testability and debuggability of all components in isolation. This approach ensures that individual pieces can be validated independently, allowing the overall product to come together more reliably.

- **Learning from experience and pushing for strategic priorities** - After the roadshow demo, Martin synthesized the learnings and advocated for the Action Sequencing and Arbitration tentpole. His ability to extract actionable insights from real-world testing and translate them into architectural decisions demonstrates exceptional product leadership.

- **Identifying critical system gaps** through his systems thinking approach. Martin has consistently found gaps in our system as it relates to holistic decision making, ensuring we address fundamental issues rather than just surface-level problems.

- **Inspiring the team to stay product-focused** by constantly asking the hard questions about whether our work contributes to shipping. This keeps everyone grounded in practical outcomes rather than getting lost in technical exploration for its own sake.

Martin's influence extends beyond individual contributions - he shapes how the entire team thinks about prioritization and product delivery, ensuring our technical excellence serves real user needs.

## I'd like to see this team member focus more onâ€¦

**Teamwork: Cultivating relationships and working collaboratively**

**Teamwork: Providing leadership and inspiration to others**

**Why did you suggest this focus area? Provide examples:**

While Martin's laser focus on shipping a product is valuable, it can sometimes come across as challenging the assumptions or work of certain projects. Although he inquires out of genuine curiosity and good intent, this isn't always perceived that way by stakeholders.

Martin could work more to foster relationships with stakeholders and frame his questions with explicit curiosity rather than appearing to challenge. Building stronger collaborative relationships would amplify his already excellent product instincts and make his valuable insights more readily accepted.

Additionally, while Martin has excellent ideas, he can occasionally get bogged down in technical weeds when his natural place to lead and understand is from an architectural perspective, given his role as a manager. Staying at the right level of abstraction would help him be more effective in guiding technical direction while empowering his team to own the implementation details.
