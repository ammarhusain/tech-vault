Did a quick ballpark assessment of replacing my Polestar 2 with a Subaru Crosstrek would drive down insurance premium to $872 from $2070 (6 month policy). Holy shit I am way overpaying for car insurance for an EV! This premium is already up from ~$1500 that I paid from August 2024 -February 2025

Calculations for total payments for 30k miles, 3 year lease:
polestar2 total - 26,756
- End up paying $5k (upfront: $1k reservation + $4k at time of pick up) followed up $642.40 * 36 monthly payments = $28,126.40 (very pricey for what its worth - tesla model 3 would have been better)
tesla model 3 - 20,776
lucid air pure - 34,822
