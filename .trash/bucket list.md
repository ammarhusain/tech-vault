- [[2025-05-12-Monday]] 
	- Chat with Scamp Trailer
		- 13' standard would need a brake controller - just an adapter on a 7 way will not do
		- Their shortest height without AC or fan vent is 7'6" so even with flattening tires it will not fit in garage :(
		- Price starts at 23399 for standard which is fully equipped with bathroom & kitchen
	- Chat with Subaru dealer and Rack n Road in San Rafael:
		- Basically the Subaru Crosstrek only provides a 4 connector pin so only tail & brake lights can be hooked up. Brake controller cannot be hooked up
		- Theres an option to hook up an aftermarket brake controller and have the wiring splice into the 4 way pin that just says whether the brake is engaged or not. The Curt Echo controller then sends the brake signal to the trailer. It can be configured via Bluetooth from your phone. 
		- From Perplexity - there is also the wired option which may be better?
			- **Curt Echo Bluetooth**: Easy install, no cabin wiring needed; Must reconnect after restart, app required; Mixed, setup sensitive; 
			- ; **Wired (e.g., Redarc)**; Reliable, factory look, set-and-forget; Harder install, may need pro help; Positive, seamless;

Mt Shasta
Mt Whitney: Stay in Lone Pine, CA and then do a day hike up to summit and back 3am - 9pm or so
Volcan Cotopaxi
[The 9 Great Walks of New Zealand \| Kiwi Experience](https://www.kiwiexperience.com/blog/the-9-great-walks-of-new-zealand) - old Japanese woman on FRA-YVR flight
Kinabalu in Borneo - good mountain to climb, very steep : old Japanese woman
Tasmania - 5 days walk from north to south : old Japanese woman

## Diving Spots
- Amed/Tulamben for quality and accessibility: shore diving, very cheap and world class macro plus USAT Liberty Wreck, a world class wreck dive!
- Nusa Penida for quality and exciting dives plus diversity: reef fish, sharks, nice corals, drift diving, strong currents in certain places, excellent vis, and of course mantas at Manta Point and the chance to see Mola Mola in the right time of year.
- Komodo for a bit of everything: only been there once but so far takes the cake as to the best place Iâ€™ve dived. Do a liveaboard and go between May and September to see the best of it!
- Mabul & Sipidan for amazing macro and amazing palegics/schooling fish, respectively: probably 2nd personal best if you combine them (but combining Penida and Amed/Tulamben would give it a run for its money).
- Koh Lanta sites Koh Ha, Koh Bida, Hin Daeng/Hin Muang: best decent quality all round diving combined with full service day boats and high quality life style on the island. Hin Daeng/Hin Muang are cleaning stations for oceanic mantas!
- Cenotes in Riviera Maya, Mexico: just incredible! Like nothing else, Angelita and Casa Cenote were highlights for me.
- Save a Tack passage, Namena, Fiji. It's stunning.
- Southern Japan/ Ryukyu Islands
- Koh Tao (Thailand)
- Fiji
- Little Corn (Nicaragua)
- Raja Ampat - liveaboard

## Small boat cruises
From Recommendo - Kevin kelly
- Galapagos â€” The boats sail at night. Every morning you wake up to a brand new island with a brand new biome. Lots of snorkeling and hiking with naturalists. We usedÂ [Happy Gringos](https://happygringo.com/galapagos-tours/galapagos-island-cruises/).Â 
- Inland Passageway, Alaska â€” Head north through the calm inland sea, visiting glacier strewn fjords, wildlife close up, and native American islands. Kayaking, too. We usedÂ [Alaskan Dreams](https://www.alaskandreamcruises.com/browse-cruises/).Â [](https://www.alaskandreamcruises.com/browse-cruises/)
- Mekong River â€” Sail from Siem Reap (and its Angor Wat) in Cambodia, all the way downstream to Ho Chi Min City on the coast of south Vietnam, with bicycle excursions along the way. Mark usedÂ [Aqua Expeditions](https://www.aquaexpeditions.com/mekong-river-cruise/).
- Turquoise Coast, Turkey â€” Join a gulet sailboat long the southern Mediterranean coast of Turkey, stopping at ancient Greek ruins, Turkish villages and swimming coves. These cruises have become very popular with party versions for young adults. I donâ€™t remember who we used but try,Â [Sail and Stay](https://www.sailnstay.com/experience/gulet-cruise/sail-turkey/).
From Nomadico
- Iâ€™ve done some great ones withÂ [Uncruise](https://substack.com/redirect/ede200da-47ff-47b3-ad13-8ae94a314b07?j=eyJ1IjoiZjJ1OTAifQ.2NHcubsSS5wBNWDW3YwcI9WIyJz4dx0auXWccynFvdg),Â [Sun Fun You](https://substack.com/redirect/2903bd4a-d71e-4963-84cc-7fd8249ac695?j=eyJ1IjoiZjJ1OTAifQ.2NHcubsSS5wBNWDW3YwcI9WIyJz4dx0auXWccynFvdg), Scenic

From old Japanese woman
- Ferry from Turku harbor in Finland to Stockholm Sweden - there are 3500 islands along the way - very scenic, big Vikings ships. 10 hour ferry ride
	- You can get a cabin for $59 while Helsinki to Stockholm is more like 200euros. Helsinki to Turku harbor is only 2 hours by bus.
- Also 5 day cruise from Gothenburg to Stockholm on the ship Juno : canal sightseeing tour guide mentioned this onw.
