- You do end up wearing the same thing over and over while traveling because that feels comfortable - stick to it. Sam as Brazil I loved the blue linen pants and the black Vince T-shirts. No point experimenting with too many clothes. Just stick to your comfort wear and you’ll be happy. Do not over pack as if you do not wear it at home then you will definitely not wear it while traveling. Only carry what you enjoy wearing in SF
- Get some linen trousers and shirts (lose fitting for travel). Tight fit makes you look small and you will be conscious and uncomfortable 
- Do not buy stuff at flea markets - you just get ripped off and the haggling is very annoying. Go to some local neighbor stores instead where locals would go to shop. If they are pestering you then their stuff is not worth it.
- Maadi and Zamalek and are the posh areas of Cairo with a lot of expats - really nice upscale restaurants and cafes with very progressive locals around. Much less of the hectic bustle compared with the old school Cairo city. It’s nice to see these neighborhoods exists in so many of the developing countries of the world from Lima to Medellin.
- Keep a zakat budget to give to little kids whenever you travel - withdraw some cash with the intention of giving it away and give it away to little kids who are not begging but either just doing their thing or selling trinkets on the street. Better to give this way than give unnecessary tips to staff who force their way. When I have kids I would want them to go and give it themselves to build this thought pattern of sharing and giving.
- Carry the thick eye mask
