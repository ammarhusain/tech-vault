# Meditations
- #travel/brazil/meditation
	- Carry duct tape with you (versatile for packing open stuff)
	- Bring fewer clothes (especially jackets/ sweater): check the weather 10x to make sure if you really need to carry it. You’ll most often feel more comfortable wearing the same thing you like over & over rather than trying new clothes combos (the black tee & blue linen pant you loved to have on rather than pairing a new light blue tee in Floripa while going to cafe culture)
	- Do more walking tours of the place as soon as you reach there
	- Don’t rush to do things - take a deep breath. Make sure the weather is good! (Rocinha was a fun tour but rain got crazy)
	- Do not pack your bags to the brim - leave room for acquisitions along the way. It also makes it hard to move around if you need to stuff it in
	- **Positives**
		- Not much work impact: stayed productive
		- Worked out a bit with a home yoga mat
		- Cooked a few meals at the airbnb and cut down outside eating
	- **Negatives**
		- Visa issues for Sana: Avianca hiccup and then Panama transit
		- Overpacked (or wrongly packed): carried more warm long sleeve clothes than needed
		- Unnecessary optimization: packing to go to Manati, rushing to download photos for sorting on flight

**Transport**
About moving around in Brazil: We did everything by bus. The bus network is very good, modern busses, reliable, and safe. They also make frequent (food) stops. And its affordable.

**Rio**
**Toby**: We loved this city! One of the most picturesque places - and very diverse. You can go hiking in the jungle in the morning and enjoy some Caipis in the afternoon at the beach without crossing the city limits. Has some sketchy areas of course but ==Ipanema== and ==Copacapana== are mostly safe (during daylight).

**Ilha Grande**
**Toby** - Tropical island, close to Rio! You can get there by bus in 4 hours. Tropical forests, empty beaches - really stunning. There is only one small town on the island, quite touristy but you could work from there, there is enough infrastructure. Also, we went diving there. It was alright but not the best. Highly recommended to spend some days on the island, if you have time.

**São Paulo**
**Toby** - Well... an enormous city. There are a few nice neighborhoods (e.g., Vila Madalena) but besides that, there is not too much to do. The big avenue is nice, especially on Sundays (car free). There are a few parks which are nice too and the Japanese neighborhood is also worth a visit. Great Sushi and Pizza! But the old part of the city is quite run down and there are many addicts around. But you are from SF, so maybe you feel right at home there.. 🤐 It's not safe to walk there after sunset or on weekends and I would be very careful anytime of the day.

Since you want to spend most of your time here - I would advice against that. Maybe visit for a weekend (if even) but everywhere else I liked it more in Brazil.

==Towns near São Paulo: Caraguatatuba or Santos==

**Paraty**
**Toby** - Super nice old colonial town. Very touristy, especially on weekends. There are some nice beaches around as well. The old town is definitely worth a visit. All in all, great to stop if you pass through the area but its quite small. I would not spend more than a day or two here. Could be nice to work from as well, since its quiet (for Brazilian standards).

**Pantanal**
**Toby** - That area is amazing, if you have the chance to visit - do it! There are a few things to consider though. First, there is a northern and southern section. While the northern is more "wild" and the wildlife is better, the southern is better accessible and cheaper. In the northern part, there are more Resorts were you stay for a week while in the southern part are more farms where you can stay. We stayed on a farm and it was a unique and amazing experience. Wildlife everywhere! I am happy to share details if you consider to go there. We started from Campo Grande. Pantanal has a bigger bio diversity than the Amazon!

**Foz do Iguaçu**
**Toby** - The famous waterfalls, a must-see if you are in the area. You can visit the Argentinian side as well (day trip). And you can go shopping in Paraguay (Ciudad del Este), just walk over the bridge! Nice to stop in Foz do Iguaçu for a few days, but the town itself is not exciting.

Ammar’s thoughts - let’s skip maybe - can go here where when we go to Argentina - it’s possible to get here from Buenos Aires

**Florianópolis**
**Toby** - This is an absolute gem. Its a "city" but its spread out over the entire island. You will find many towns with lush rainforests, hill, secluded beaches, and cliffs in between. There are many outdoor activities you can do here and its just beautiful. And not very touristy... at least tourist do not concentrate on one single place. Different towns have different vibes (luxurious, hippie, ...). We stayed here in a Hostel that has digital nomads as their target customers with high speed internet and dedicated office areas - I am happy to share details.


On average checked bags cost +$21 per bag per flight on LATAM and Gol
