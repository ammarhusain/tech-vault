	- Joe Shady Cove Planning Department
		- Brand new ordinance that was passed in 2025
		- Looking at property & location - he thinks its possible to get STR
		- It needs to be at least 500ft apart
		- Written consent is required from all neighboring property owners - and all adjoining owners (3/4 of them need to consent - 75% of affected property owners)
		- 10 people max occupancy, not more than 2 cars
		- It is a conditional use permit - could have some subjective affects (generally should be the case)
		- ADUs cannot be used period - not even in tandem
		- Does not know the history of this particular property
		- May be have the agent knock on the neighbors door to find out more - neighbors consent is the most powerful
		- If you meet all the requirements then he sees no reason why city would not approve

- [ ] Ask Gigi how it would work if we did not take out a mortgage to incorporate her agent credit? Would we need to pay tax on it if it is a gift at closing?

- More or less remodeled already -could buy & rent but not much to do interior wise
- Only work project would be to build an ADU in the back and rent that out. 
- Agent Maryanne Villamil said she can give me some details on what it might cost to build the ADU and other offmarket listings she has - could follow up

- A big house but might be hard to section off into multiple units to rent. Could certainly get a nice interior update overall however.
- Would have to see what neighboring house are like but could get converted into a bougie one perhaps and flipped to sell

- Most interesting of the ones we visited today. 
- Downstairs room could potentially be legalized and created into its own unit. Ceiling is a bit too low
- Upstairs could get a nice update - more or less cosmetic so definitely something we could tackle - kitchen, bathroom remodel, new fireplace may be.

Chat with Sandy - Chase bank
Was pretty distracted & meh so i might want to find a different chase agent
6.875% - 30y fixed SFH (investment) and 6.99% (7.05% APR) for condo
Can use RSU: need 2 years at the company.
There are some rate discounts that chase offers on top of this

Chat with Jamie Myers - Travis Credit Union
Interest rate for 30 year fixed SFH: 7.65 and Condo = 8%
30 year fixed are usually lower than ARM because they are conforming loans that are bought by Fannie Mae typically who set the rate on them.
JUMBO loans atm are of principle > $766551
Investment property interest rate is 0.5-0.75% higher than owner occupied. Travid Credit does not do jumbo loans for investment props - must be owner occupied
Assuming purchase price of 1M with 25% down (typical for investment properties)
My DTI is pretty high though assuming 260k income along with 5.8k mortgage + 600 HOA + property tax + 650 car payment + payments for 1M investment property -> 58%
They require DTI to be under 45%
If I am at Apple < 1 year, ideally 2 years then equity + bonus can be factored in. (they basically want to see 1 year + 1 refresher grant)
Including Sana could be tricky as well because for independent contracting she needs to have worked at least 2 years.
Her recommendation is to file 2023 taxes then they can try and take 2022 & 2023 tax filings to determine whether the income counts -> ie run it by an underwriter -> then start an application to get a pre approval letter
In order to be under DTI I'd have to put down at least 700k on a 1M purchase price.
