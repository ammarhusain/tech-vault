## Highlights
#### BERGSON AND RECENT FRENCH PHILOSOPHY
- It seemed to Henri Bergson (1859-1941) that from the beginning the function of the senses in living organism has been not to provide the organism with 'representations' of its surroundings but to stimulate reactions of a life-preserving character. What they provide us with are not objective pictures of our surroundings but messages that cause us to behave in certain ways. (Page 214)
- Bergson gives the name 'elan vital' which translates to 'life force'. He elieves that because everything is changing all the time, the flow of time is fundamental to all reality. We actually experience this flow within ourselves in the most direct and immediate way, not through concepts or our senses but through 'intuition'. (Page 215)
- Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-80) was one of the leading proponents of existentialism. He believed that people's awareness of their own freedom induces in them anxiety, and that they take refuge from this anxiety in 'bad faith' - by pretending that they are bound by already existing norms & rules. (Page 216)
- Sartre's friend Albert Camus (1913-60) was the writer who coined the description 'absurd' for the situation in which human beings demand that their lives should have significance in an indifferent universe which is itself totally without meaning or purpose. It is a demand, Camus insisted, that can never be met. (Page 217)
- The world is not what I think, but what I live through - Maurice Merleau-Ponty (Page 218)

- Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908-61) insisted that it is fundamental to our identity as human beings that we are physical objects, each one of which has a different and unique location in space or time. Not only must everything that can ever be experienced by anyone be experienced through the unique physical apparatus of one such object: the whole of the rest of reality can be apprehended only from the perspective of its unique point of view. We are perpetually aware of our bodies, and without them we cannot perceive or act. (Page 218)
- Merleau-Ponty wrote with great penetration and insight about the deep philosophical problems involved in subjectivity, including its inescapably perspectival and therefore inherently incomplete character. (Page 218)
- 'Structuralism' aka the 'the linguistic turn in philosophy' - put at its simplest, structuralism is the view that any discourse of any kind, philosophical or otherwise, is a structure in language and that is all. The text does not present us with anything other than itself: there is nothing 'beyond' the language. This led devotees of structuralism to interpret texts primarily in terms of rules governing the various uses of language. (Page 219)
#### POPPER - FROM SCIENCE TO POLITICS

    - Note: - should be 'known'
- For Karl Popper (1902-94) physical reality exists independently of the human mind, and so we can never apprehend it. We create theories to explain it, and use them for as long as they work. However, eventually each theory will prove inadequate and we replace it with a better one. (Page 222)
- We make progress not by adding new certainties to a body of existing ones but by perpetually replacing existing theories with better theories. The search for certainty, which obsessed some of the greatest Western philosophers from Descartes to Russell, has to be given up, because certainty is not available. (Page 223)
- A statement that no observation would falsify cannot be tested, and therefore cannot count as scientific, because if everything that could possibly happen is compatible with its truth then nothing can be regarded as evidence for it. A good example would be the statement 'God exists': it has meaning and might be true, but no intellectually serious person would regard it as a scientific statement. (Page 223)
- Society too is in a state of perpetual change, and the pace of that change is increasingly fast. These things being so, the creation and perpetuation of an ideal state of society is not an option for us. What we have to do is manage a process of endless change that has no stopping place. So what we are engaged in is perpetual problem solving. (Page 224)
#### THE FUTURE OF PHILOSOPHY - INCREASING ENLIGHTENMENT ON A QUEST TO WHICH THERE MAY BE NO END
- We can make such worthwhile progress in our understanding of the human situation that even if we never reach any ultimate goal in that respect we shall find that the journey is hugely enriching experience that is worth undertaking for its own sake. There may be no final answers, but there is a wonderful lot to learn. (Page 227)
