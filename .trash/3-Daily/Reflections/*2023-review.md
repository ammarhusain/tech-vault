Planning too far or too much in detail for the future. Go with the flow.
I would stop with my "fear of missing out"

#### What Would I Start Doing?

Being grateful for what I have. Enjoy the current moment. There is nowhere else to go
Reaching out & staying connected

#### Enjoy the Climb

##### What Do I want to Spend More time on next Year?

Travel & exploration
Building a community

##### What Do I want to Spend less time on next Year?

Tracking my portfolio & net worth
Obsessing over minor disagreements or losing small sums of money.

#### Make Things Happen by Going Positive and Go First

##### Where Am I Waiting for Another Person to Make the First Move?

To make plans to meet up

##### What Can I Do to Go Positive and Go First?

Come up with a preset things to do or want to try - then invite friends to join.

#### Planting Seeds for the Future

##### What Can I Do in the next Week that Will Make the Rest of the Year Easier?

Buy a home :)

##### What Can I Do This Year that Will Leave Me in a Better Position for next Year?

Learn a new skill - touch typing
Visit 3-5 new countries

#### Film-crew

##### What Am I Doing that I’D want the Film Crew to See?

My adventures & explorations

##### What Are the Things I’M Doing that I DON’T want the Film Crew to See?

Picking my nose; nervous, unsure talk when I am all up in my head.

#### Yearly Goals Are Great to Keep Your Eye on the Prize but IT’S Better to Break Them into Weekly or Monthly Goals to Keep You Going

##### What Are My Goals for 2023?
```dataviewjs
dv.taskList(dv.pages().file.tasks
	.where(t => (t.text.includes("#_2023") && t.tags.includes("#goal"))))

```

##### Do I Have the Right Systems in place to Make Them Happen? what Needs to Change?

Yes Obsidian is a game changer :)
I need to embrace the messiness and trust my system more. I need to stay focussed and avoid distractions.
