**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-07-31)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- Slept in till 8.30am. Got breakfast in the room then head over to Vida coffee. Worked on Video Llama, Quip doc responses and random stuff. Pita Pit for lunch
- Jose called creating an urgency to get the guest bathroom shower faucets. Had to scramble to get that ordered so Miguel can start tiling. Ordered a Delta rough in valve from Home Depot for him.
- Long ass & unproductive memory meeting at 2.30pm and lasted like 1.5 hrs
- Went to the pool with Sana. Showered and head to the village
- Met up with Vora-Aashna for dinner at an Italian place - it was great.
- Hung out in the village for a while after eating ice cream and then a glass of wine at a cafe - got a free crepe and donut
- These guys came over and we played Phase 10 till midnight.

- Was feeling quite a bit low through out the day
