**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-09-04)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- Breakfast with Rumana masi Huzefa uncle today. Then they helped us move from Brians Ocean beach apartment. Continued the move and cleanup in the afternoon. Check on painter at [[home#117 Topaz Way, Sf, Ca - 94131]].
- Bikram yoga in the afternoon at 4. Feeling pretty low this evening for no good reason. Kinda feel like a loser career wise. Like no one would entrust me with anything responsibility wise. I perhaps come out as too soft or sensitive.
