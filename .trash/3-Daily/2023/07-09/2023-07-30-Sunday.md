**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-07-30)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- Woke up around 8 and went to the village to get coffee & breakfast. Long chat with Alifiya about Umri picnic and its aftermath. Got bagels from a deli which was great. Came back and went to the pool for a swim.
- Left for Crystal Lake hike around 11.30am. Hiked for like 2.5hrs - it was a nice & beuatfiul hike around the lakes.
- Went to Mary Lake to kayak - inflated my kayak but it was a pain to do so. I think I need to get rid of this kayak for a raft or SUP maybe.
- Got done around 5.30 then went to Mamoth Brewery for a beer, food and live music
- Got back to hotel and met up with Vora-Aashna by the pool. Went for a swim & hot tub.
- Showered, chilled and then they came over for playing Clue - interesting game.
