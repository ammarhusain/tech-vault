**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-07-22)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- Spoke to mom in the morning then head for Yoga
- Jose messaged that he wants to show up early so head directly to 117 Topaz from there. Spoke to the tile guys. Followed up on his plans for the electrical and plumbing work
- Got brunch at Lele a turkish spot in inner sunset, back to the AirBnb and napped for a bit
- Cleaned out the Airbnb and got organized. Felt much better and in pace afterwards.
- Head over to 117 Topaz again to clear out closet and garage cabinet for him to install steam generator next week. Made some progress but still a bunch needs to get done
- Chinese food for dinner while watching SABA center
