**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-07-04)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- Went to 117 Topaz way to clear out a bunch of stuff. Demolition work was going on in full swing.
- Got the workers cup cakes & cookies for working on a holiday
- Thought about heading to Home Depot but got lazy
- Chilled at Adil-Maleehe's home - watched Ludo - fun evening
