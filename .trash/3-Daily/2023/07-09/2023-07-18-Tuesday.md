**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-07-18)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- Went to 117 Topaz to meet Jose in the morning to chat about some electrical work and miscellaneous stuff. There is a tie down on the kitchen wall that he will need to move before tearing down that section. Gave him check #2 for 50% of the electrical work.
- Head over to Ma03 after. Met Marissa at the bus stop. Morning was fairly unproductive trying to figure out the underlayment to order. Just went with the 2mm floor & decor one for him to pick up tomo.
