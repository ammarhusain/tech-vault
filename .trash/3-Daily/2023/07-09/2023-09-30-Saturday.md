# TOP-OF-MIND
- Jose & crew came in this morning for finishing stuff up. Made a bit of progress but still stuff left.
- We went to Chase to deposit cash then Boulangerie to grab a bite.
- Came home - Sana went to Target, dad & I cleaned out driveway gutter. It was choked really bad
- Late lunch then went to Room & Board
- Came back did a bit more house work - downstairs bidet (wrong size), curtain rods in guest bed etc
- Dinner at Old Jerusalem restaurant.
