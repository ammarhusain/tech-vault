**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-07-12)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- Long morning with Jose at the house figuring out all the electrical work. Fireplace Lindsay also came to talk about framing. Sana & I went there earlier in the morning at 8.30am which was good because we figured out a lot of the recess light placements and were on the same page before talking with Jose as he marked everything down. Got done around noon
- Rushed back to catch up on work stuff
