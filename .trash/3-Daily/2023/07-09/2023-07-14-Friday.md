**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-07-14)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- Felt like a productive day on [[j595 journal#2023-07-14-Friday]]  today. Got more comfortable within the codebase.
- Called mom & dad in the evening - got a bit pissed off with mom and her questioning the remodel progress. Triggered me in the same way she thinks a lot of things are worthless, and imposes her opinion that I should feel tired/bored of it. I felt  that she does not understand me or my interests. A lot of my aggression was unwarranted but coming from a place where I felt she is yet again criticizing my life choices and telling me that I am making a mistake.
- Got ramen in the inner sunset afterwards - really good beef ramen
