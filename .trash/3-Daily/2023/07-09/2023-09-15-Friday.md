# TOP-OF-MIND
Interviewed Michael Watterson for Senior motion planning eng
	- Darpa robotics challenge in grad school - state estimation & control
	- Did a class in robotics & learning - IRL, some bayesian filtering, SLAM
	- Worked on high level semantic planning, have a patent on multi agent optimization, policy planning
	- Built common API for 20 different MP algorithms
	- Got a trajectory of agents: [position, velocity, yaw velocity] etc. Massaged it to work in the  planning stack
	- Reactive model is expensive to compute onboard
	- Bunch of heuristics evaluating out of distribution data.
	- Specification on ML system that can up or down weight training data.
	Style transfer for trajectories:
	- some people want high level semantic - translating these to optimization primitive - run some sort of IRL
	- collect data - may be with mocap systemto collect data.
	- Find optimization criteria that correspond to happy, sad to max jerk, acceleration : use IRL to find these
	- Take an L2 or mahalanobis attractor to bias trajectories toward 
	- Not super informed on ML. Neural nets are blackboxes for him
	- Not too familiar with RT-1 or RT-2
	- Worked in interfacing with ML people not directly on training models per se
	- Multi modal prediction - 
	- Strong depth in optimization algorithms
	- NN outputs 20 seq length numbers trajectories; 
	- Good about what the model should do to fit into MP algorithms - not much about the architecture or training by itself.
