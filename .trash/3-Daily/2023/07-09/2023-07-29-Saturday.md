**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-07-29)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- Went to 117 Topaz in the morning. walk through and check ongoing work. Dan @ 115 msged to complain about work happening over the weekend.
- Bumped into Teresa and Anthony as we were leaving - took them on a walkthrough around the house to show all the work.
- Started driving toward Mammoth Lakes. Met up with Vira-Aashna at Groveland. Then drove to Olmstead point on Tioga Pass road in Yosemite NP
- Bumped into Daniel Kappler, Victor and their partners randomly at Tenaya Lake in Yosemite. Interesting coincidence.
- Reached Westin, checked in and then ordered food into our room. Chilled in the room for a while before hitting the bed.
