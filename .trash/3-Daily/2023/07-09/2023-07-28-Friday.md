**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-07-28)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- Did not sleep super well. Was a bit over stimulated with the socializing last night.
- Long walk through with Jose on the electrical and plumbing stuff pre inspection. Made a few decisions with him around lighting and where to put switches. Gave him 3rd check [[home remodel]]
- Head over to Neighbors around 10am to meet Kunal there. Long chat with him (~1.5hrs) and it was good catching up #social 
- Yoga at 5pm and then dinner at Izakaya Shabu
