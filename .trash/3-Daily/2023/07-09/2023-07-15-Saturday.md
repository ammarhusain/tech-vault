**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-07-15)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- Went for Yoga in the morning - rushed and got late for appointment with Jose though he didnt respond whether he was heading over or not until after he got there.Any way chatted with him on the electrical work. He seemed very chirpy  and said that he is trying to wrap up all the electrical stuff and downstairs bath to get inspections done by Friday. Also figured that the recessed lights for down stairs will be off centered so need some alternative.
- Came back home and went to Ocean cafe for a bit to do some house work research. Turns out the thick underlayment he brought is out of stock most places and also quite a bit more expensive. Also settled on LED strip lights for the stairs
- Went to 620 Jones for dinner and followed by SF playhouse musical #social
- Crazy incident happened at play when someone collapsed and they had to pause the show for like 20 or mins.
