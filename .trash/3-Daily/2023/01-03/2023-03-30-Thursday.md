# TOP-OF-MIND
- Day was a blur. Extremely exhausted by the move yesterday.
- Doordash C++ interview in the morning
- Tried to install curtains but that turned out to be a project. Went hunting for a drill at Target, Costco & finally Lowes. Had pizza & hotdogs at Costco for dinner.

dv.paragraph('```tasks\n ' + query1 + '\n' + query2 + '\n```');
