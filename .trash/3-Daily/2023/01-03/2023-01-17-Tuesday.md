# Top-of-mind
- Finally got my office desk setup after months of delaying on it
- Long chat with Mithun - then with Mithun & Mikael
- Very unproductive day over all mostly trying to get by doing low hanging stuff like:
	- Obsidian clean ups etc - setup linter, Minimal theme settings
- Chat with Josh: Definitions for capabilities vs skills vs tasks makes sense.
	- Just add terms that might have been used before to help people make connections - eg: primitives.

## Tasks
```dataviewjs
const date = `${dv.current().file.name}`
const query1 = `(has start date) OR (has due date) OR (has scheduled date) OR (has done date)`
const query2 = `(done on ` + date + `) OR (due on ` + date + `) OR (scheduled on ` + date + `) OR (starts on ` + date + `)`
dv.paragraph('```tasks\n ' + query1 + '\n' + query2 + '\n```');
```

## Vault Updates

**Notes created in the last week:**

``` dataview
TABLE file.folder AS Folder, file.ctime As Created
WHERE file.ctime >= date(substring(this.file.name,0,10)) - dur(1 week) AND file.ctime < date(substring(this.file.name,0,10))
SORT file.mtime ASCENDING
```

**Notes modified in the last week:**

``` dataview
TABLE file.folder AS Folder, file.mtime AS Modified, file.ctime AS Created
WHERE file.mtime >= date(substring(this.file.name,0,10)) - dur(1 week)
AND file.mtime < date(substring(this.file.name,0,10))
AND file.ctime < date(substring(this.file.name,0,10)) - dur(1 week)
SORT file.mtime ASCENDING
```
