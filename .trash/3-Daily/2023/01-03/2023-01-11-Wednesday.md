# Top-of-mind
- Spent the day at the SF office reading through papers related to robotics task benchmarking Spent the morning tweaking and tuning Obsidian. Creates [[vault management]] to store snippets of various query code. Installed Various Complements plugin
- Singing lesson today was fun as always. Got to work on modulating pitch and beat.

# Tasks
```dataviewjs
const date = `${dv.current().file.name}`
const query1 = `(has start date) OR (has due date) OR (has scheduled date) OR (has done date)`
const query2 = `(done on ` + date + `) OR (due on ` + date + `) OR (scheduled on ` + date + `) OR (starts on ` + date + `)`
dv.paragraph('```tasks\n ' + query1 + '\n' + query2 + '\n```');
```
