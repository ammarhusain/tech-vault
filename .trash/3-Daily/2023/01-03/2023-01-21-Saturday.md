# Top-of-mind
- Woke up super early and not having slept well. Read "hoe to take notes - sonke ahrens" shortform for a bit and then walked over to arsicault to grab some croissants.
- Slept off for another hour and a half in the morning at like 11.
- Checked out 4 open houses. My mind wasn't engaged because now I am thinking that I should somehow maximize this time of forced sabbatical / leave by traveling some where. Finally do what I have been wanting to do for a while when work got in the way. Should I travel some place? Should we both just give up this apartment and vagabond for a bit?
	- May be check out how much storage will cost? Could go live in Mexico for a month? Or Europe or South America?

## Tasks
```dataviewjs
const date = `${dv.current().file.name}`
const query1 = `(has happens date) OR (has due date) OR (has scheduled date) OR (has done date)`
const query2 = `(done on ` + date + `) OR (due on ` + date + `) OR (scheduled on ` + date + `) OR (happens on ` + date + `)`
dv.paragraph('```tasks\n ' + query1 + '\n' + query2 + '\n```');
```

SORT file.mtime ASCENDING
```
