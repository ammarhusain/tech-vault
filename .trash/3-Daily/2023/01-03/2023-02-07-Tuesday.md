# Top-of-mind
- Went to Barrys this morning after almost a week and a half of infections. Felt great
- Lunch with Martin, Victor & Paul H from Apple to chat about their project
- Sent an offer for 117 Topaz Way.([[home buying]]) Hope they accept it.

## Tasks
```dataviewjs
const date = `${dv.current().file.name}`
const query1 = `(has happens date) OR (has due date) OR (has scheduled date) OR (has done date)`
const query2 = `(done on ` + date + `) OR (due on ` + date + `) OR (scheduled on ` + date + `) OR (happens on ` + date + `)`
dv.paragraph('```tasks\n ' + query1 + '\n' + query2 + '\n```');
```

SORT file.mtime ASCENDING
```
