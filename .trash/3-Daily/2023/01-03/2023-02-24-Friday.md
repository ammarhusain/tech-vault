# Top-of-mind
- Build a 3d digital model os the work.. photrealistic. focus on 3d reconstruction
	- support terrain map, full city scale
	- operate as a platform, clients are other teams within geo or google.
	- client teams use their models
	- bryan is are TL for base model
- have to deal with many clients; prioritize requirements
	- have somebody understand; how we fit into this eco system; help fit into the eco system with all clients
	- what is important and what is on okrs
	- deprioritize features that are not important; ambiguity with clients on who is building what
	- upstream teams - teams that collect data; downstream - the various client teams
	- helpful to have someone who is updated on research
	- sustained, automated features
