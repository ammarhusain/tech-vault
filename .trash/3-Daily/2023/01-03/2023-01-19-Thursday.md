# Top-of-mind
- Super unproductive day after a nice morning workout. Just couldn't get myself to do anything
- Ended up reading just the VIMA paper and went home. I felt intimidated going through this other link that turned out to be like <5 mins of work/reading time. Its more in my head than anything else.
- Read up more on Gleangen & prediction markets at home.

## Tasks
```dataviewjs
const date = `${dv.current().file.name}`
const query1 = `(has happens date) OR (has due date) OR (has scheduled date) OR (has done date)`
const query2 = `(done on ` + date + `) OR (due on ` + date + `) OR (scheduled on ` + date + `) OR (happens on ` + date + `)`
dv.paragraph('```tasks\n ' + query1 + '\n' + query2 + '\n```');
```
