# Top-of-mind
- Really pushing hard to get [[home buying]] closed.
	- Got checking account # from Citi branch on Castro
	- Home insruance quote from StateFarm.
		$1764 / year,  $500 deductible
		Covers uptown $341000 of home remodel (fire, theft, vandalism etc), Personal property $75k, Personal Liability $500k
		Liability protects me against potential law suit (lets say neighbor sues due to fire started)
		Water damage is tricky for coverage
		Earthquake & flood is covered by separate policy
		CA state provides earthquake insurance policy.
		Bundling auto insurance gives  discount -> 1669/year (not much)
		If there is burglar alarm 1641/year (with auto discount)
		Auto quote was $822.30 / 6 months while comparable GEICO coverage is ~$550 / 6 months
	- GEICO doesnt cover homes here
