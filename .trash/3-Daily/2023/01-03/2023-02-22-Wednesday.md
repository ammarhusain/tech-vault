# Top-of-mind
- Chat with Stafford at Google Geo 3D [[career/career]]
	Humility & wanting to learn; Have some of the best 3d engs; Need someone who doesnâ€™t think they know it all; Hunger for 3d
	How do you collaborate & inspire the team; Collaborate with other teams on roadmaps
	Mostly partnering with other orgs within geo; Focussed on making 3d models
	Some impact cycles are longer 2-3 years
	City scale 3d models & meshes, some manual edits; Need to create atomic objects
	Point clouds are stereoscopic for lidar; Street view have lidar
	3 customers:
	1. Route preview for navigation
	2. Developer API for tiles (unreal tiles)
	3. GeoAI - analysis capabilities, provide semantically segmented datasets
	Have some core tech but that has been mostly unchanged for 10-15 years. Room for growth & experimentation
	Excited of digitizing the planet; have taken extended scope and working on getting better at delegation
