# Top-of-mind
- Today has been a rough day so far (11.58am)
	- My project for the last 4 years at Google X / Proxy / Everyday Robots has been cancelled by Alphabet
	- It feels really weird. On the one had I felt done & frustrated with the progress at the project but on the other hand I also feel like I have failed. In building something meanigful. In delivering something revolutionary. While I would have prefered leaving of my own accord the severance package Alphabet is offering isn't super bad. Should I take it and rest for a bit?
	- Or should I strive to find something within the company?
- ====Setup git back ups for my obsidian vaults as a cron job every night.==== It was a pain in the butt since I was very unproductive and distracted. Tried using cron. Was actually pretty easy but I just didnt create an easy enough sandbox for myself to quickly test & iterate.

```dataviewjs
const date = `${dv.current().file.name}`
const query1 = `(has happens date) OR (has due date) OR (has scheduled date) OR (has done date)`
const query2 = `(done on ` + date + `) OR (due on ` + date + `) OR (scheduled on ` + date + `) OR (happens on ` + date + `)`
dv.paragraph('```tasks\n ' + query1 + '\n' + query2 + '\n```');
```
