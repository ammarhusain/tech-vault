# TOP-OF-MIND
-     

Checked out of Tokyo hotel and took the Shinkansen to Kyoto. Was feeling a bit under the weather after the Fuji trip. Should have really bought the inhaler. Dropped luggage at the ryokan and went to a nice cafe nearby. It was a cute theme & vibe. Had two ice cream floats there. Then took the bus over to Kinkakuji temple. It was hot and very crowded. My best time there was at the tea shop. Went back to ryokan and were served delicious hot tea and matcha again. Then went in for a bath at 6 before dinner. Dinner was a really really tasty kaiseki cuisine meal. Posted some stories to Instagram and went to bed.
