# Top-of-mind
- Huzefa-Alifiya and family coming into town
- Their car got broken into in Oakland - typical unnecessary hassle creation
	- Met Bo, a homeless guy there who helped them retrieve passports

- Came across this library for [[transformer]]: [GitHub - facebookresearch/xformers: Hackable and optimized Transformers building blocks, supporting a composable construction.](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers)

# Tasks
```dataviewjs
const date = `${dv.current().file.name}`
const query1 = `(has happens date) OR (has due date) OR (has scheduled date) OR (has done date)`
const query2 = `(done on ` + date + `) OR (due on ` + date + `) OR (scheduled on ` + date + `) OR (happens on ` + date + `)`
dv.paragraph('```tasks\n ' + query1 + '\n' + query2 + '\n```');
```
# Vault Updates
## Notes Created in the Last Week
``` dataview
TABLE file.folder AS Folder, file.ctime As Created
WHERE file.ctime >= date(substring(this.file.name,0,10)) - dur(1 week) AND file.ctime < date(substring(this.file.name,0,10))
SORT file.mtime ASCENDING
```

## Notes Modified in the Last Week
``` dataview
TABLE file.folder AS Folder, file.mtime AS Modified, file.ctime AS Created
WHERE file.mtime >= date(substring(this.file.name,0,10)) - dur(1 week)
AND file.mtime < date(substring(this.file.name,0,10))
AND file.ctime < date(substring(this.file.name,0,10)) - dur(1 week)
