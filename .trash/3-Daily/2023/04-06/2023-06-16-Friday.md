# TOP-OF-MIND
- 2 dives in the morning
- Came back to a iced espresso and fruit salad. Cleaned up and took a nap.
- Went over to Neptunes in the afternoon for like an hour and half. It seemed like a nice place to chill for longer
- Got back to Trudys and did a bit of email cleanup. More transcription from story of philosophy. Cleared out Raindrop
- Attended Quentin's dive master graduation party - he is a cool & nice guy. It was fun watching the Utila dive master traditions.
- Had dinner at RJs (went for the chicken but found only the king fish interesting).
- Came back, chilled for a bit and crashed early - like 10ish.
