# TOP-OF-MIND
- Went diving with divemaster Jessi in the morning at 7am.
- Initially buoyancy was quite off and I didn't know how to put my gear together. But I figured it out soon enough.
- Came back, put a mask on and chilled for a bit
- I dove with my phone!! It survuved the day but would not charge. 
- Spoke with Kevin from Apple recruiting on start date etc. Finished some of the Apple paperwork as well.
- Chatted with Sana for a while too.
- Walked over to Marios for some seafood pasta which was good.
- Came back and hung out at Trudy's. Met up with Cate for dinner at a tiny shack a little further out from Edo's. Pescado Entero was great.
- Chilled at Edo's for a beer and then walked back.
- Stayed up late summarizing the philosophy book until a bit past midnight
- Woke up early in the morning went out for Dive. Anxious initially, and a bit groggy because I hadnâ€™t had coffee but when I jumped in the water was actually fun to be out there nice and refreshing. 20 minutes into the first dive I realize that I left my phone in my pocket. Between the first and the second die, if I felt a bit of motion, sickness, and thought I might throw up but then I powered through it. Went back at the dock. Way to the river to get us some shower, spoke with Sana and Kevin from Apple
