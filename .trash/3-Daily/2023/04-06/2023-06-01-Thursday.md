# TOP-OF-MIND
[[job search]]
- Applied Intuition interview in the morning with "leads" Peter & Majed - Peter came across as super arrogant. Got pretty vibes about the work culture there.
- Felt really off my game throughout the morning/ day
- Coding Interview with Modular - interesting question. I got the answer but could have done a lot better. I felt rusty
- Long chat with Suzanne at LHH - mostly discussing how recruiters approach hiring. Very insightful getting her perspective
