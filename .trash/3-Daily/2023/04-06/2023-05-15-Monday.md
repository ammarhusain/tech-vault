# TOP-OF-MIND
-     

Had breakfast at Inoda coffeehouse - very popular place with locals. Food and coffee were both great though expensive. Did laundry and then decided to head to Osaka since the Aoi festival got postponed. Took the train over to Osaka station and then had an adventure finding bel vie pancake station in the Osaka station basement. Pancakes were fluffy and amazing. Then went to a conveyor sushi place right across from it in Whitt Umeda central hall. Sushi was awesome too - over ate a bit. Head over to the Osaka museum of houses - it was great to experience how people in Heian times ~250 years ago used to live. Nice little coffee at a banana themed restaurant in the building where the museum was housed after that. Went to Dotonbori and walked around a lot! Sana did a bit of shopping while I just tagged along. Went to the hozenji eat street around there and sampled a bunch of food - yakitori, karage etc. finally ended up at a little izakaya where we sat on the counter and were served delicious Japanese tapas. Took train back to Kyoto and ended up back at hostel around 10.30pm
