# TOP-OF-MIND
- Morning at Neighbor Cafe
- Looked up LangChain videos - I think I have a decent idea now. Learned about Streamlit - much easier way to build web apps for ML stuff
- Bunch of job scoping chats: Modular; Yang with Applied Intuition; Andrew Tao @ NVIDIA
- Afternoon was a bit of a drag. Mostly called fireplace companies. Jose Gonzalez pushed meet last min
- Nice hike through Glen Canyon Park followed by chill dinner at home.

dv.paragraph('```tasks\n ' + query1 + '\n' + query2 + '\n```');
