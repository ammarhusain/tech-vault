# TOP-OF-MIND
- Broke the Apple news to Umriwala
- Spent the morning with Sana at Neighbors cafe - felt very overwhelmed with all the decisions that need to be made around tiling and style palettes for the house [[home remodel]]
- Yoga at noon - felt a bit relaxed but was super stressed to make it in
- SDI fireplace guys stopped by - not that productive but an option.
- Had dinner with Kay & Quinn at 119. Nice family and a fun evening
