# TOP-OF-MIND
- Dies in the morning woke up late anyway.
- went for two dives in the morning woke up late and made it in time anyway, it was great to be out in the water.
- came back with a cuppa coffee and fruits.
- went to get lunch at mermaids for pizza today.
- afternoon mostly walking around UTila. Tried to go to the chocolate factory, but it was closed. long walk back
- bought a mask and snorkel try out for the night dive, and subsequent dives.
- Night dive was phenomenal - we saw an octopus and the bioluminesence was crazy.
- Went over to get some Baleada for dinner.
