# TOP-OF-MIND
- Had a chill coffee in the morning with some emails. Head over to the ferry. Was just daydreaming through the ferry ride. It arrived 15 mins late into Roatan so that made it super tight to catch my 12.30 United flight. Luckily I didnt need to check in my bag so was able to make it right on time as the boarding was slowing down. Initial technical snag on the flight but it eventually took off 20ish mins late. Finished reading [[2-Focus-Areas/Readwise/Books/On Fear]] on my kindle.
- Connecting flight transfer was chaos and slow with no pre-check at Houston airport. Head over to terminal C and then to the Centurion lounge. Was quite a trek but I was super hungry so was good to get the food there even though the line for the lounge was annoyingly long. Didn't spend too much time there and head straight for the SFO gate. Flight was a bit delayed again but not bad. Did a bunch of photos filtering from Japan & 2023 in general on the flight so that was productive - and also nice to revisit the memories. 
- Sana picked me up from the airport and had a nice dinner at home
