# TOP-OF-MIND
- Sana's birthday today - made her coffee & grilled cheese breakfast.
- Dropped Sana to Glen Park BART for her Figma conference and then morning at Philz today.  Met Nishanth for [[wearscape-ai]] advising. Learned about delegating projects to Upwork which was interesting.
- Lunch and then went over to Progressive in Bernal to finish reading [[2-Focus-Areas/Readwise/Books/The Story of Philosophy]]. It was a bit distracting initially thinking about [[home remodel]] stuff. Was a bit irritated since he still hasn't secured a city permit for the work.
- Picked up Sana from BART then Vora, Aashna & his mom came over to hang for a bit - that was nice of them
- Birthday dinner at Chouchou french bistro which was quite nice.
