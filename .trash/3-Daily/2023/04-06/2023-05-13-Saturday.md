# TOP-OF-MIND
-     

Checked out of the ryokan. Could have slept better the night before. What an amazing experience. The hostess and check out staff waited at the door until we were out of sight and kept waving and bowing at us.

Checked into Piece hostel. Nothing would match up to the Ryokan experience. Walked to Yasaka Jinja shrine, got ramen then continued walking to Kiyomizu Dera temple. It was an incredible monastery and I can only imagine living there as a monk in the peace and quiet.

It started outing heavily so we stopped at a local cafe for matcha and red bean rice dessert. Took a cab back and stroller through Nishiki market. Street food there was so so good.
