# TOP-OF-MIND
- Chill morning
- Transfered the transcribed highlights into readwise using CSV
- Afternoon dives with Gil
- Saw a bunch of cool stuff and felt more in control during the dive. I really need to get better at identifying fish species.
- Had wings at Trudys and went over to Tequila Tuesday at Tranquilos.
- Back to the hostel a bit past 11am.

dv.paragraph('```tasks\n ' + query1 + '\n' + query2 + '\n```');
