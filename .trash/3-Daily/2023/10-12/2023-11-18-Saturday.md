**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-11-18)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
-  #journal/daily 
	- Met up with Karna, his cousin, Ankush, Utsav for dinner at Rahee saoji. It was good but super spicy. Chilled at Utsavs place for a while and then hung out with Ankush till like 2am. It was good to bond with a childhood friend - something I can only do at max once a year. Its a bummer that I have moved so far away that ties to my growing up days are just a few thin strands in my day to day existence.

# TASKS
```dataviewjs
const date = `${dv.current().file.name}`
const query1 = `(has happens date) OR (has due date) OR (has scheduled date) OR (has done date) OR (has created date)`
const query2 = `(done on ` + date + `) OR (due on ` + date + `) OR (scheduled on ` + date + `) OR (happens on ` + date + `) OR (created on ` + date + `)`
dv.paragraph('```tasks\n ' + query1 + '\n' + query2 + '\n```');
```
# CROSS-REFERENCED 
```dataviewjs
// Loop through pages 
for (let p of dv.pages()) {
	for (let ol of p.file.outlinks) {
		// find all the cross references of this file
		if (dv.current().file.path == ol.path) {
			// get all the lists in this file
			for (let ls of p.file.lists) {
				if (ls.text.includes(dv.current().file.name)) {
					dv.header(3, p.file.link + "  ...  " + ls.line)
					dv.paragraph(ls.text)
					dv.paragraph("---")
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```
