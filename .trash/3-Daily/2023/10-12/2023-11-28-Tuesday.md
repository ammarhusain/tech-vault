# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Chat with Martin:
	    - Get on a feature - be on the critical path
		    - General feedback: have not hit my stride yet
		    - Have something more direct to point to
		- [x] #j595/todo Sync on what scene understanding is needed photographer (mark p & xin); greeter (anton & reza) & attention system (jakub) ✅ 2023-12-14  [completion:: 2025-01-30]
	- Productive chat with Jakub on AttentionKit
		- I can help out with creating a TinyLlama model that takes as input the scene description and outputs the attention scores.
		- Its very similar to what Xin is doing for Photographer
			- Create a synthetic dataset using 70B llama
			- Finetune a TinyLlama model
			- Update TinyLlama model with correections to dataset
			- Maybe down the line do RLHF where HI scores the different attention scores
