# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily
	- Tiger safari in the morning. The guide Ajay was super knowledgeable and talked about his techniques in spotting tigers. Its like forensics signs where they study the movement patterns on tigers and lay that on their knowledge of the roads in the park to narrow down where a tiger would be at any point in time. Really enjoyed learning about the art of listening to calls & spotting tigers. We saw a 3 yo female tiger!
	- Went to Mathurs in the evening for Diwali

	- Not much work. Just attended 1:1 with martin followed by the ML brainstorm with some AIML team Charlie, Shawn etc.
