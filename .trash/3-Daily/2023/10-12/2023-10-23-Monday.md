# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Just finishing up some trainings: Respect & Bias - 2 trainings
	- Reading up on finetuning LoRA adapters on lightning.ai: [Parameter-Efficient LLM Finetuning With Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) - Lightning AI](https://lightning.ai/pages/community/tutorial/lora-llm/),
	- The finetuning dataset is the Alpaca 52k instruction dataset described [here](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca#data-release), which has the following structure:
		![](https://lightningaidev.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lora-6.png)
		- The dataset itself was generated following the method described in the [Self-Instruct paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560) and consists of 49,759 training examples and 2000 validation examples.
			- ![[2023-10-23-Monday-2023-10-23.png]]
			- Adapter used about 22 Gb and finished 62,400 iterations in 162 min on an A100. LoRA used 21 Gb of memory and finished in 192 min.
		- perplexity, BLEU, and ROUGE scores are some of the most common evaluation metrics used in natural language processing to assess the performance of LLMs across various tasks. [[metrics]]
		- [x] #j595/todo - need to figure out what metrics can be used for the planning dataset tasks for evaluation. ✅ 2024-03-15
			- BLEU is a metric for n-gram precision between translated text and reference text. It penalizes a brevity penalty. ROUGE is similar but it is focussed on recall instead of precision and without any brevity penalty.
				- More details in the slides 24 here - [[XCS224N_Lecture15_Slides.pdf]]
		- [ ] #j595/not-todo  - Train a baby Llama architecture using karpathy repo + photographer dataset (from Xin) -> run inference on this model using LlamaCpp [[ajax]]

- #journal/daily 
	- Went for fun dives in the morning [[scuba diving|scuba]]
	- Forgot to turn the tank on after having jumped in the water. Then I forgot to wear my mask as Luis announced everyone to descend.
	- Chatted up with Tobi on the boat. Went with him & Mirna for lunch at Mario's. Got the ceviche
		- They are an interesting couple and have spent the last several months traveling around the world. Hit it off with them.
	- They went to Neptunes while I left to go back to UDC for Sana's confined dive session. Chilled over there for a while.
	- Got back to hostel, showered etc
	- Made plans with Tobi & Mirna to head over to Tea Room (from yesterday) for trivia and curry night. Took a tuktuk over #social 
	- Met Deggs again - super spicy karahi chicken. Was a fun evening overall. Walked back to Mango.
	- #journal/meditations Paid Jordan for my dives with Visa. I was really going back & forth on how to maximize the 4-4.5% surcharge. Amex was 4.5% but could have gotten us access to Centurion lounge. I really need to stop overanalyzing on little decisions where the stakes are only a few dollars. Just look at the bigger picture and do the easy thing even though it might come out a bit more. Would have made life easier later on Sunday when I had to argue with Amex customer service for a guest fee waiver. On the brightside we caught the earlier standby flight to SFO so it worked out in the end.

```dataviewjs
// Loop through pages 
for (let p of dv.pages()) {
