# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Refactored palazzo-llm-ws app code to log everything to comet in the end. There was significant latency when logging at every step. Tested changes with mark and it seems to bring response times back to being as good as local
	- Got the comet server with Shield & static ip up & running again. Had to create an app server in the nginx shield config and then publish changes. [AppleConnect Sign In](https://shield.corp.apple.com/home/vips/94A55863E55C49C89A7FFBCCD358A8AF/app-server)
	- Made Blanca admin on Comet. Resolved the 403 Forbidden error by allowing the PATCH Request Method in HTTP under WAF overrides on Shield NGINX server. Going to Inspect on Arc and then the Network tab helped.
	- Fun rabbit hole: Played around with LLMLingua [CoT.ipynb](https://github.com/microsoft/LLMLingua/blob/5c30ebea68fda6dccf62ee7539915692e4d61517/examples/CoT.ipynb) that Andreas posted. Here is the summary of my experiments in this text file: ([Slack thread](https://a1391192.slack.com/archives/C04VBGWNT52/p1703036867941339?thread_ts=1703013843.581779&cid=C04VBGWNT52)) ![[LLMLingua prompt compression experiments.]]
