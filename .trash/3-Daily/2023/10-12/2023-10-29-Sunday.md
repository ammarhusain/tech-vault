**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-10-29)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Most of the day was traveling today.
	- Took the 7am ferry that reached LA Ceiba 7.45am. Got into the shuttle and started drive over to SAP. Got to the airport around 11.20am which was great time.
	- Were pretty hungry but the food options after security check were pretty meh.
	- Got to Houston and got on the standby for earlier SFO flight. Went out of the connecting flight security check area to terminal D to get TSA pre-check. Tried getting into Amex lounge again but seems like my guest access still not unlocked. Long argument with customer service rep for that - I need to stop wasting time on this crap.
	- Swung by the C34 gate for earlier SFO flight and we were able to get seats. Hopped on it. PRetty tired & hungry on the flight. Also felt a bit sick (cold).
	- Got home - ordered pho for dinner and passed out.
