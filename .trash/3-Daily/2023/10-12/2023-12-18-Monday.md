# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Looked into setting up SSO for Comet with Apple.
		- SAML seems to be the way to go:
		- [AppleConnect Sign In](https://idms.apple.com/docs/services/authentication/saml/overview)
		- https://apple:c62406846525b5d1ae388252e97eebc2@deployment-docs.comet.com/deployment-docs/deploying-comet/sso_integrations/saml/#jumpcloud
		- [[SAML Vendor Documentation.pdf]]
		- 
	- To sponsor people for disclosures file a request here: [Disclosure Central](https://dc.apple.com/new)
		- Doing it for a couple Yi's people at T172
	- Chat with Martin
		- How do I make an impact here with out getting too constrained?
			- Design docs & reviews dont seem to work. Nobody reads them, cares about them or holds it as POR
			- *Continue pushing on LLM based attention*
		- Whats going on with Luke? Some candid thoughts
# NOTES CREATED IN THE LAST WEEK
``` dataview
TABLE file.folder AS Folder, file.ctime As Created
WHERE file.ctime >= date(substring(this.file.name,0,10)) - dur(1 week) 
AND file.ctime < date(substring(this.file.name,0,10)) 
AND file.folder != "Daily"
SORT file.mtime ASCENDING
```

# NOTES MODIFIED IN THE LAST WEEK
``` dataview
TABLE file.folder AS Folder, file.mtime AS Modified, file.ctime AS Created
WHERE file.mtime >= date(substring(this.file.name,0,10)) - dur(1 week)
AND file.mtime < date(substring(this.file.name,0,10))
AND file.ctime < date(substring(this.file.name,0,10)) - dur(1 week)
AND file.folder != "Daily"
SORT file.mtime ASCENDING
