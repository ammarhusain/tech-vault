# TOP-OF-MIND
-  #j595/journal 
	- [builds.swe.apple.com](http://builds.swe.apple.com/) lists all the available OS/SDK builds that are available at Apple. A -> .0, B-> 0.1, C-> 0.2 and so on. This is the place to usually go and check for non customer SW builds
	- Picked up DVI cable from Office Depot in Colma and a USB stick from Staples just to get Ubuntu box up & running.
	- Met up with Mihai for lunch and went to the 2 visitors centers to pick up t-shirts.
	- Pretty good article for setting ssh on linux box: [How to install ssh on Ubuntu Linux using apt-get - nixCraft](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-install-ssh-on-ubuntu-linux-using-apt-get/)
	- Its working now! `ssh j595@17.220.14.223`
