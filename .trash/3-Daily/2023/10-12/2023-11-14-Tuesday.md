# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Clarify with Andreas: Photographer integration with Comet:
		- what conda or venv environment does this app run in?
		- in order to log prompts should they be [added here](https://github.pie.apple.com/heavenly/palazzo-llm-ws/blob/main/app.py)? 
	- [Language Modeling Is Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10668.pdf)
		 - Arithmetic coding transforms a prediction model into a compressor, and, conversely, a compressor can be transformed into a predictor by using the coding lengths to construct probability distributions following Shannon’s entropy principle
		- Language models take a very different “approach” to compression compared to classical compressors. Classical compressors have a small program size and optimize for a large context length to exploit sequential dependencies in the data. In contrast, foundation models consist of billions of parameters, which enable rapid adaptation in their (relatively) short context lenghts.
	- Long debugging call with comet folks on nginx config and uploading large model files.
- #journal/daily 
	- Intervention for mom in the morning - talked about how she needs to restore comms with dad, deal with her anxiety issues.
	- Lunch with Zaheer & Fatema Akola at Gondwana club. Bumped into Ashna Mehta there as well.
	- Intervention for dad at Starbucks in the afternoon - similar chat as with mom.
	- Went to the Batras in the evening for Diwali.
# TASKS
```dataviewjs
const date = `${dv.current().file.name}`
const query1 = `(has happens date) OR (has due date) OR (has scheduled date) OR (has done date) OR (has created date)`
const query2 = `(done on ` + date + `) OR (due on ` + date + `) OR (scheduled on ` + date + `) OR (happens on ` + date + `) OR (created on ` + date + `)`
dv.paragraph('```tasks\n ' + query1 + '\n' + query2 + '\n```');
```
# CROSS-REFERENCED 
```dataviewjs
// Loop through pages 
for (let p of dv.pages()) {
	for (let ol of p.file.outlinks) {
		// find all the cross references of this file
		if (dv.current().file.path == ol.path) {
			// get all the lists in this file
			for (let ls of p.file.lists) {
				if (ls.text.includes(dv.current().file.name)) {
					dv.header(3, p.file.link + "  ...  " + ls.line)
					dv.paragraph(ls.text)
					dv.paragraph("---")
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
