**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-10-22)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
-  #journal/daily 
	- BIRTHDAY!
	- Went for a dive at 7.30am - it felt great being out in the water [[scuba diving|scuba]]
	- Lunch - fish fingers & fries followed by a nice hour long nap (2-3pm) . Woke up at 3 when Sana got back to the room.
	- Went to Tea House in UTila for yorkshire tea + sponge cake.
	- Deggs the british guy at teah house was super chatty and a bit typicaly white colonialist (may be racist) dude. He didnt let us focus on the diver courses
	- Came back to Mango Inn - responded to a bunch of birthday messages.
	- studying section 1 of EFR workbook
	- Left for dinner around 8.30pm. Was a bit late since a lot of places were either closing or already closed. Bumped into Jordan on the way who said both fun dive boats were packed so I wont be able to go diving tomo. That bummed me out quite a bit
	- After aimlessly walking around main Utila st for a while, I decided on Marios for dinner wven though the ambience is meh.
	- Got the linguine pasta with white sauce (chicken) which was great. Jordan messaged that a spot opened up on the AM boat which lifted my mood back up.
	- Back to Mango and watched Puff on Netflix for a while as I gulped down Hersheys Cookies & Creme chocolate bar.
