**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-10-19)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Trying to setup Jakub's machine.
	- Lit review - Sheared Llama
	- W&B meeting:
		- Go with AWS instance if possible. Need database, S3 datastore and then a compute instance (docker container). One or more of these 3 components can be in AWS or local. Can always start local and then migrate.
		- Next steps: Setup some time with Yi, Venky etc. Venky & Julia will be in touch.
	- RoPE scaling on llama-cpp is pretty cool. You can set it for passing in context lengths larger than 4k.
	- Long chat with Hans on characters that the device would have - and how do we build that. character.ai like
	- [ ] #j595/meditation I really need to get better at figuring out what roots mean and understand the Apple OS eco system - Dawn, Crystal etc. How do I use a dev device and flash code on it. Or check the apps running on the system?
