**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-10-26)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Confined dive session all day today. Was a super hectic day. Saw Tamara & Mirna there who were working on their freediving course. Had a quick lunch at UDC itself - chicken rice bowl. 
	- At the end of the confined dive session - 3 of the staff jumped in the water. We had to rescue them from the dock. Made a spectacle out of it. 
	- Sana finished her OW course today. Bought Sam & her a beer at UDC.
	- Went back to Mango Inn showered and then head over to Mango Tango for fondue dinner. Had the lion fish carpaccio - super delicious. Met the Spaniard server who moved to Utila to get his DM.
	- Head back home since everybody has a long day tomorrow.
