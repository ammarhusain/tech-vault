# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Woke up late 10am. Went over to Husaina phupi in the morning. Huzefa fly came back from Burhanpur. Hung out, had lunch and started watching the world cup match. Napped while watching the game but Daniyal woke me up by yelling in my ear. Went to take a shower and then head over to Utsav's for a couple of hours. Met up with Debashree her husband & Ankush there. Got back by 9, had kababs for dinner and then head out for a drive through the city to gauge the environment after world cup loss. Picked up pan along the way. Hit the bed around 11 and watched Koffee with Karan for a bit.

dv.paragraph('```tasks\n ' + query1 + '\n' + query2 + '\n```');

for (let p of dv.pages()) {

			// get all the lists in this file
			for (let ls of p.file.lists) {
				if (ls.text.includes(dv.current().file.name)) {
					dv.header(3, p.file.link + "  ...  " + ls.line)
					dv.paragraph(ls.text)
					dv.paragraph("---")
				}
			}
