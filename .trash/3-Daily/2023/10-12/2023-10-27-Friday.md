**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-10-27)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
-  #journal/daily 
	- Went for 2 fun dives in the morning with Sana. Our first time diving together
	- Had a quick lunch at UDC again - chicken fajitas specials.
	- Started rescue diver open water briefing at 12.15pm.
	- Bunch of rescue drills & scenarios in open water today.
	- Got done around 5pm. Did my long walk across the Utila dive shops. Went to UDC, Altons, Underwater vision etc.
	- Bumped into Tobi at Paradise where he was heading for his night dive. Made plans to go to RJs with them.
	- Had a nice long chat with the operator guy at the Hyperbaric chamber. Learned a lot about how the chamber works. Apparently ~1 diver a month ends up in there.
	- Kept going back & forth about leaving the island Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning.
	- Back to Mango Inn and chilled by the pool. All the other folks at the hostel started gathering around - Tamara, Andreya, Mirna. Changed plans to head over to Mister Buddha instead for sushi/asian fusion.
	- Had the sesame ramen chicken & lion fish ceviche at Mister Buddha. Also tried the lion fish tempura sushi there. Food was pretty good overall.
	- We all went over to Utila Brewing Co after. Didn't stay there very long but the vibe seemed quite nice.
