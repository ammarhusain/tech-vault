# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Good overview of Apple Watch ultra for hiking [[camping & backpacking]]
	- Went through a bunch of Oceanic+ and watch wayfinder face tutorials
	- Resolved line items for Jeurieb contract [[home remodel]]
- #j595/journal 
	- Here are the steps I could take for model distillation:
	 1.  Can I use the GPT built from scratch to test how to loss reduces by training on a custom photographer dataset?
		- Use a proper tokenizer rather than character level thing
	2. Train a llama model and use karpathy's baby llama2.c script to do inference on the model
		1. Try running this model with llama-cpp
	3. Try trainin LoRA adapters for the models
