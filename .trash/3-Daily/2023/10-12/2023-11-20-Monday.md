# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- #journal/meditations What also got in the way were the people themselves - all the smart people who could argue against anything but not _for_ something
		- This was an interesting insight about google culture - [What I learned getting acquired by Google](https://shreyans.org/google)
	- #journal/meditations I am at the peak of my career years at the moment - the next 15-20 years are crucial for me to grow and develop. I need to get better at optimizing for my time & energy over money. Simple example: should have just booked the 8.20am flight to BOM rather than 6am and spend a sleepless night tossing & turning.
		- Also I need to prioritize what I want in life and not get guilted by sentimental views. If I make a mistake - note it down and move on. Example: I should have gone to CP club for a workout today instead of driving to W. But I didnt, I regret it and just move on.

# TASKS
```dataviewjs
const date = `${dv.current().file.name}`
const query1 = `(has happens date) OR (has due date) OR (has scheduled date) OR (has done date) OR (has created date)`
const query2 = `(done on ` + date + `) OR (due on ` + date + `) OR (scheduled on ` + date + `) OR (happens on ` + date + `) OR (created on ` + date + `)`
dv.paragraph('```tasks\n ' + query1 + '\n' + query2 + '\n```');
```
# CROSS-REFERENCED 
```dataviewjs
// Loop through pages 
for (let p of dv.pages()) {
	for (let ol of p.file.outlinks) {
		// find all the cross references of this file
		if (dv.current().file.path == ol.path) {
			// get all the lists in this file
			for (let ls of p.file.lists) {
				if (ls.text.includes(dv.current().file.name)) {
					dv.header(3, p.file.link + "  ...  " + ls.line)
					dv.paragraph(ls.text)
					dv.paragraph("---")
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```
