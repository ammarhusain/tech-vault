**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-11-30)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- All prompts on superserver are logged in `cd ~/deploy/staging/palazzo-llm-ws`
	- Spent most of the day trying to setup a base initial prompt to tinker with for the attention llm scorer -> in the [junkyard pynb](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0d3CNjKp03F8fYWrYqanf_24Q#junkyard) for now - using the llama-cpp-python binding might be easier to experiment (per Xin) than using the command line
	- Setup mac studio and remote development packages on xcode to try and run models on there instead

# TASKS
```dataviewjs
const date = `${dv.current().file.name}`
const query1 = `(has happens date) OR (has due date) OR (has scheduled date) OR (has done date) OR (has created date)`
const query2 = `(done on ` + date + `) OR (due on ` + date + `) OR (scheduled on ` + date + `) OR (happens on ` + date + `) OR (created on ` + date + `)`
dv.paragraph('```tasks\n ' + query1 + '\n' + query2 + '\n```');
```
# CROSS-REFERENCED 
```dataviewjs
// Loop through pages 
for (let p of dv.pages()) {
	for (let ol of p.file.outlinks) {
		// find all the cross references of this file
		if (dv.current().file.path == ol.path) {
			// get all the lists in this file
			for (let ls of p.file.lists) {
				if (ls.text.includes(dv.current().file.name)) {
					dv.header(3, p.file.link + "  ...  " + ls.line)
					dv.paragraph(ls.text)
					dv.paragraph("---")
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```
