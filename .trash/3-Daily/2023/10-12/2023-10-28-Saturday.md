**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-10-28)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	-  Had an early start at UDC - 7.15am. Got the toast with cheese & veggies at UDC. Rescue diver briefing.
	- Went out on the boat around 8am. Sana went for her open water dives.
	- Fun drills & exercises underwater again. Mike had his tank lose so I had to fix that for him as well. Practiced the surface non responsive diver rescue again. Then did the U-pattern search.
	- Back to the dock. Chilled took pictures, some paperwork etc. Talked to a bunch of people about the drive from La Ceiba to San Pedro Sula and it seems like 3 hours should be enough time to make it. 
	- Went to get Baleadas for lunch. Bumped into the aussie guy & french girl at Mama Rosa. Chatted with them for a bit.
	- Back to Mango and just chilled outside on the hammock for a while. Took a nap. Booked the shuttle to SAP airport from the ferry.
	- Woke up and went to Pumpkin hill. Got coffee there at Rockies bar. Walked around. A lot of beautiful house being built there mostly by Americans it seems like. Checked out the beach as well. Got bit by too many mosquitoes.
	- Tuktuk back into town and walked around looking for halloween gear if any. Back to Mango, packed, showered etc.
	- Went to the UDC halloween party for a bit. It was fun - got the bbq chicken. chatted with a few folks and back.
