**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-10-24)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- My [[scuba diving#Rescue Diver Certification]] began today with EFR .
	- Went to UDC prompt at 8am but they other dude Manny in class didn't show up until 9.15am. We got started and watched a 1 hour 38 min long video. It pretty much covered everything that I had already read up in the EFR book. Did knowledge reviews then had a break for lunch. 
	- We thought about heading to Mermaids but then ended up going to Gaga's that Manny from class recommended. Food was very good but took forever to come.
	- Classroom again in the afternoon at 12.45pm. Learned how to do CPR. More knowledge reviews and final exam. Got done around 4ish.
	- Back at Mango Inn after class and had a beer at the bar. We were considering heading over to some place (dont remember which - may be Trudy's for wings?) for dinner. But then Tobi messaged saying that they are all grabbing pizza at Mango Inn itself. Met up with them and Tamara, Tim & Andreas (italian dude) that evening. 
	- Heavy rain that night so good to have stayed in. Though I had to walk out in the rain to get some toothpaste & chocolates so got very soaked.
	- Cozy night in - started to watch The Last Breath (or was it still Puff?)
