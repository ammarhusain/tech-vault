# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/meditations 
	- I feel like I can grasp and understand complex concepts and even map or apply them in novel ways. I just struggle to DO - make actual use of them hands on. I get too bogged down may be with perfectionism, going too slow on the first few easy steps such that by the time I get to the meat of the problem I am already tired/exhausted.
	- The best way for me to build wealth is just to not think about it and keep it coming for the next 5-8 years. When I was enjoying being a PM at Google for the one year - I grew my wealth without obsessing over it.
	- Dont be too thin-skinned. Its ok if people question you or undermine you - KEEP PUSHING AHEAD! Be stupid and appear stupid. Everyone hates or questions each other anyway. No need to look good just need to get your way.
- #j595/journal 
	- Filling out the [FC2 planning numbers doc](https://www.icloud.com/numbers/0b0JAxAKH0OxtN6bky7c-bEIg#FC2_Scoping_Perception) 
	- Interesting paper presented at lit review by Xin - Tomography of LLMs to map neural activations RePe
	- Long photographer discussion. Agreed on 3 things
		- All tracks will come from Motif/ EntityKit
		- Mark will use some detector from VU to get scene bounding boxes
		- VQA will be used later for photographer memories while VU detector model will be used for framing & composition.

# TASKS
```dataviewjs
const date = `${dv.current().file.name}`
const query1 = `(has happens date) OR (has due date) OR (has scheduled date) OR (has done date) OR (has created date)`
const query2 = `(done on ` + date + `) OR (due on ` + date + `) OR (scheduled on ` + date + `) OR (happens on ` + date + `) OR (created on ` + date + `)`
dv.paragraph('```tasks\n ' + query1 + '\n' + query2 + '\n```');
```
# CROSS-REFERENCED 
```dataviewjs
// Loop through pages 
for (let p of dv.pages()) {
	for (let ol of p.file.outlinks) {
		// find all the cross references of this file
		if (dv.current().file.path == ol.path) {
			// get all the lists in this file
			for (let ls of p.file.lists) {
				if (ls.text.includes(dv.current().file.name)) {
					dv.header(3, p.file.link + "  ...  " + ls.line)
					dv.paragraph(ls.text)
					dv.paragraph("---")
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
