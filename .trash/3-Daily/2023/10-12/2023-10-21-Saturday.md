**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-10-21)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Most of the day was spent getting to Utila from SF. Passed out on both United flights and for a bit at the KLM lounge in houston.
	- Took an Uber to Power Chicken in San Pedro Sula. It was packed out there so we just packed food and got it back to SAP airport.
	- Flight to RTB-UII at 3pm. Chilled at priority pass lounge sipping coffee.
	- Small propeller plane to Roatan and then an even smaller 10 person prop plane to Utila. Got here around 4.30pm.
	- Checked into Mango Inn and then walked over to UDC to check in for courses. Got a drink at Underwater Vision. Bumped in to Dr Gil divemaster.
	- Came for the UDC grad party at 8pm. It was popping. A lot of the food was sold out however.
	- Bumped into Yuchen from [[edr]] over here which was a big coincidence. He is doing his divemaster training here. Will be assisting Sana in the OW course.
	- Took a bunch of birthday calls, got baleada from las costina and then went back to Mango Inn to turn in for the night.
