**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2023-10-10)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Read up on ReAct, BLOOM etc.
	- Xin gave me a good overview of Axlearn, AJAX etc. 
	- Sounds like Axlearn (aka AJAX internally) is a framework for model training on TPUs.
	- This is an Apple internal and publicly released version of JAX. Its comparable to [Megatron](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM), [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat) etc that are equivalent for GPUs. 
	- JAX is a sucessor to Tensorflow which became bloated & convoluted. JAX makes it easier to define model architectures that then get compiled. The only thing the user needs to specify is model & data parallelism. They do not need to individually decompose the model into a distributed system of GPUs and TPUs. For JAX the compiler is super powerful to handle that.
	- [ ] #j595/someday  Walk through this [AJAX tutorial](https://github.pie.apple.com/foundation-models/ajax/blob/d61a8b368e1a6a8062123591ee30548ee5b6f913/README.md) to get a feel for it [[ajax]]
