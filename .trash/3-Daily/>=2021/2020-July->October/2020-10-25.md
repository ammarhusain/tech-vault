# Daily Notes
- Feeling a bit anxious this afternoon, not sure why
- Read NewYorker article about Signal CEO
- Learned a bunch about spinning up GCP instances etc .. Using proxyfleetcontrol-dev .. Hope it is ok
- `gcloud compute scp instance-1:~/path ~/local_path`
- Had to set the project to Proxyfleetcontrol-dev ... might need to change it back in `gcloud config`
- Running out of CPU memory because the image features take up 80GB... Could muster a max of 50GB on GCP. Ended up pruing the training from getting loaded in memory since I just wanna run test inference on there anyway.
- Goal is to get the test_results.json to pass and spit out metric on EvalAI dashboard.
