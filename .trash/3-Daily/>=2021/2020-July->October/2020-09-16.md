# Morning Pages
- Highlight: Get started on experimentation report
- Grateful for: working along side smart colleagues
- Let go: of the little momenths that you obsessively recollect & try to develop zingers for

# Daily Notes
- Watched the first lecture of MIT [[GEB]] course, nice & slow while taking a bunch of notes. It was good, getting the hang of it.
- I need to work on setting a cutoff time for my morning learning & reflection period to ease into the workday faster.
- Finished reading [[CrowdCompute]] tutorial. It was meh. probably best to bug Deva or Justin.
- Cleaned out 3 WorkPackages
- Submitted bakeoff #2 and hw #3 for NLU class
- Was supposed to start the Dialects class but that didn't happen due to tech difficulties
- WTched module 5 on [[metrics]] & methods for NLU. This would be useful as I start preparing the experiment report tomorrow.
- PNG->AnnotatedProto conversion: `blaze run research/vision/loco/tools:plain_images_to_annotated_images --
 --input_pattern="/cns/ix-d/home/x-proxy-ml/ammarh/wfov_pngs/*" --output_directory="/tmp/wfov-ann" --flume_exec_mode=LOCAL_PROCESSES`
- Then copied files over to [[CNS]]. Filed a bug for Justin to send it over to [[CrowdCompute]].

# Reflections

# Accomplished
- WFOV Images packed and ready for annotation
- closed out old work packages

**mood:**
