# Quick Summary

**workout:**
**activities:** Biking
**mood:**

# Reflections
- Went on a bike ride with Adam. It felt great but my legs were quite sore for some reason and I was going slower than usual. It was also a bit more windy but I think my muscles were sore.
- Was feeling a bit lightheaded when I got back and also overwhelmed. I wanted to do the Python class project but had no motivation to get started so just ended up watching TV.
- Overall was a productive weekend in terms of connecting with people.
