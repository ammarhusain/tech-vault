# Daily Notes
- Meeting with Chi about CBr:
	- b/169704804 Have Mitri eyeball to make sure no weird point cloud segmentation .. Pass over to Sean/Ting if everything ok.
	- Random crash of CBr where it sends a scan with very few points all of which gets ego masked out. Initially semantic_localization_module was crashing because of a sanity check when there was no usable info in a new scan. Chi disabled that sanity check, so we might be silently failing, but there is an error that gets logged (though no one really checks for that). Most likely this happens and recovers but it could also lead to missed detections for a long'ish period. Apparently happens only once in 2months or so
		- Reenable patch in semantic_localization and make a note in triage doc.
