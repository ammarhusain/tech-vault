# Reflections
- Work was meh. Dont really remember what I did. Had a Triage Tools sync up meeting which seemed promising. Will see how it goes moving forward.
- Workout in the park again and then met up with Zahra for dinner. It was pleasant and good to be out after a while.
- Came back and got into Myth of Sissyphus. I like the idea of absurdism.
