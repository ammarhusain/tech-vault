# Daily Notes
- Ran Sarahs ripper ... took a while but here are the results [txui](https://txui.corp.google.com/get?cmd=%2Fcns%2Fix-d%2Fhome%2Fx-proxy-ml%2Fammarh%2Floco_wfov%2Fsorty_wfov.sstable)
- Answered Felixs long pending profiling email
- Emailed KJ about sim TVC and Tools QA workflow test plan
- Run an NSP classification for NLU project on the last token instead of CLS since CLS might be tuned for cross-modality so it does crap on the NSP task. At least try out using the last token.
- Figured out why NSP token was not learning anything ... Was not actually switching out the function program in the paired sem_query ... aka actually use other_datum after sampling it
