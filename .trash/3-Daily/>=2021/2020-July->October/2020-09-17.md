# Morning Pages
- Highlight: Understand the experiment report, finish NLU metrics & methods module
- Grateful for: The beautiful neighborhood I live in
- Let go: ego

# Daily Notes
- Reading up on NLU [[metrics]], but at 50% focus:
- Practiced touch typing for ~40 or so mins. Its hard but hopefully I am getting better.
- Found another crash, this time in the cbr_deskewer module by Roger (b/168836616). This log replay issues are getting out of hand. I think I ll have Mitri set up a guitar test for replay_subsystems that just runs through the entire pipeline and makes sure nothing crashes. How could we build something that also catches shit like the StereoAndRobotStateProto?? I could milk the F* out of this
- LunchClub chat with Ronak Masand on their parking valet startup
- Grounded language understanding seems interesting. watched most of the module videos at night. I could perhaps work on a deep RL chatbot for the class project?? [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02349)
