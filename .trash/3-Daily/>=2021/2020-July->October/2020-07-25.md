- Worked on getting evaluations & inference + visualization code working for sem seg.
- Debugged loss by hand coding prediction vectors and running it through softmax & NLLoss. Also ran through simple optimization. Good exercise to grasp and isolate loss function & optimization debugging in [[pytorch]].
- Went to play tennis with Uday & Adam. Was fun.
- Did some more coding at night.
