# Quick Summary

**workout:**
**activities:** tennis
**mood:** happy, relaxed

# Reflections
- Had a great chat in the morning with folks back home.
- Video chatted with Danyal and spoke to Shamoil for a while. Also synced up with Alifiya for a while. It felt great to connect and talk to everyone there. Helped get rid of some of the anxiety of what goes on behind my back. Seems like they are super happy in their life.
- Played tennis with Uday for a bit. It was ok, need to work on my strokes.
- Went to Adil & Maleehes place to hang out in the evening. It was great to kick back, relax and chat there.
