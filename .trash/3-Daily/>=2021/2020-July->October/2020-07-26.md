# Reflections
- Good [[pytorch]] GPU memory debugging session in the morning. Figured out that the upsampling layers for sem seg are very memory intensive to [[3-4 - Neural Networks and Backpropagation|backprop]] through.
- Confirmed loss going down, but IoU (or may be predictions) are still restricted to just a few categories.
- Hung out with Tarin & Emrah all afternoon at the park. Was good to be out & relax
- I think I need to develop a [[Philosophy]] backbone. Like figure out the key ideas so I can more eloquently describe new learnings. I think I understand the topic but need to be better at talking about their novelty by relating it to this philosophy backbone. ([[2023-06-22-Thursday]] [[2-Focus-Areas/Readwise/Books/The Story of Philosophy]])
- Watched some Alain de Botton (school of life) [[Philosophy]] videos & started on [[Myth of Sissyphus]].
