# Reflections
- Morning was productive. Read some semantic seg blog post. Cleared out Toboist and addressed Triage Tools comments.
- Didn't mind the Panoptic seg meeting either, for which I usually feel nervous.
- Afternoon was a drag. Procrastinated and then took a nap.
- Got more riled up the the visualizer tools team. I need to calm down & let it go there rather than mentally spinning on it.
- Evening workout in the park was good and refreshing. Watched Blade Runner 2049 to wrap out.
