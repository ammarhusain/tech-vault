# Daily Notes
- Yesterday evening: 3 issues discovered with StereoAndRobotStateProto regeneration:
	 - navigation_ripper does not wait for stereo ripper. this results in navigation channels not incorporating camera stereo. (b/167691149)
	 - frame_id missing in StereoAndRobotStateProto ((b/168558245)
	 - image_disparity (at least header timestamp) missing.(b/168558245)
- Sync with Olga & Mitri... Trying to get them to be more independent. Mitri ran into the scoped_egl context cuda error you ran into before. [[CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES]] didn't fix it for him.
Ran the `plain_images_to_annotated_images` that Stefano pointed me to for wfov images but does not seem to work

# Reflections
- Had a long chat with Leena, the Colombian girl who works at Thinkers cafe. Might need to ask her number one of these days if she continues to flirt.
- Trying to set up a meet with Yuen (facebook dating)

# Accomplished
- Good progress toward a nice Notion setup for books and incoming media. I am getting the hang of the database & properties idea
