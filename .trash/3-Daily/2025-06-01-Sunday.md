##### TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- We docked at Skagway at 6am. We took our time getting out though.
	- Sana and I ate quickly at the buffet and went out to find out about the train tickets and other tours.
	- I was a cute little touristy town reacreated with the gold rush era facades. We got an option for renting a private van with an audio guide along the same route as all the tours so we picked that.
	- Since we were in control we spent some time walking around the town for a bit. We got some coffee and backed snacks and then headed out.
	- We drove across the Canadian broder to Yukon.
	- We did some quick stops along the alway to admire the scenery
	- We also spotted a bear over a hill! Alifiya woke up from a nap and suddenly spotted it.
	- We reached carcross and got some lunch there - chicken tenders and fries with some pot pie
	- I picked up a coffee and we drove to Emerald lake.
	- We took some pictures there and found our way back to the ship.
	- We stopped on the way to play with snow for a bit
	- We got back pretty soon - dropped the car and went to a souvenir store
	- We walked over to the ship
	- Got dinner at bordeaux
	- Turned in after
