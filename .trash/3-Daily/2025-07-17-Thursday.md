##### TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Appointment with Dr Ruidas to go over paperwork for my STD/FMLA segwick leave. I told her that I want to take 4 months off and she said thats a lot to claim right away. Said 6 weeks is good to claim to start with and then reassess. I will have to meet her halfway through the 6 week leave and then at the end to assess how the treatment plan is going. For my treatment I added (i) meditation & (ii) finding a new therapist as my treatment goals. I can just say I have been seeking therapy from a friend and that has been helping a lot more than a Lyra therapist. 
		- To extend the leave I can say that my treatment involved going to spend time with my parents in India and taking care of them as the new treatment plan along with yoga
