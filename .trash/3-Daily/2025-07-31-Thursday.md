##### TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- LLMs code generators tend to use really old library versions. Need to make sure to point them to the most up to date ones. For example Claude code went with plaid-pythin version 9 while v35 just came out that is several generations newer. It had to redo the entire app code for the new library versions. Should make sure that its not locked into something from the past.
