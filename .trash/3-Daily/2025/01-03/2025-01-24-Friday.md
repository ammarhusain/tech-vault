# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily

- #j595/journal 
	- Created root and shipped out to QA for rdar://141230692 (Audio is missing at the end of Casper utterances)
	- Dug further into silent audio tokens from Bubbles/ OpenAI - live debug session with Marios & Teddy
		- rdar://143547941 ([Run-through 1/23] We lost Casper consistently throughout the demo)
		- rdar://143548111 ([Run-through 1/23] Casper started randomly talking about a shopping list and saying you're welcome during the Assistant section)
		- Turns out the last 4 item id is in the wav file too so much easier to search than what I was doing before by correlating timestamps
		- Wrote a tool to detect silence in audio for over N secs - shared results with Saari & Teddy (rdar://143598411 (Tool to detect wav files with silent audio larger than N=10 seconds))
			- ![[silent_audio_detector.py]]
	- the discrepancy between audio transcript and audio from OpenAI/Bubbles
		- [rdar://14354 8111](rdar://143548111)Â ([Run-through 1/23] Casper started randomly talking about a shopping list and saying you're welcome during the Assistant section)
	- 2 Interviews for ML engineers and chatted with Chaitanya about my debugging work since Saari asked him to help loadbalance
