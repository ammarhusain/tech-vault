	- A lot of analysis on rdar://143519700 (Observing 4 second delay between receiving audio packets from server)
		- Delay was on OpenAI side where it did not get a packet for 4.386 s
		- Looked into this further with Teddy. This might just be a Bubbles / OAI issue in that we did not receiv
		- e any audio packets for 4386 milliseconds while supersaver was waiting around. The 5 pings in between the delayed audio.delta events indicates there wasnâ€™t much latency between superserver and client

	- Setup J310 to try testing root for rdar://141230692 (Audio is missing at the end of Casper utterances) : Marios requested it
	- Got a new Facetime bug assigned for investigation: not very reproducible according to Luke Ma: rdar://143371307 ([Run-through 1/21] Casper automatically accepted the incoming FT call without user consent)
