	-  [s1: Simple test-time scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19393) documents a new reasoning model with 2 novel contributions:
		- [S1: The $6 R1 Competitor? - Tim Kellogg](https://timkellogg.me/blog/2025/02/03/s1) & [S1: The $6 R1 Competitor?](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/5/s1-the-6-r1-competitor/)
		- finetuned from Qwen 2.5 32B on **just 1000 questions paired with reasoning traces** distilled from Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, filtered for difficulty, diversity, and quality (26 mins of training on 16 H100s)
		- controllable test-time compute by either forcefully terminating the model's thinking process or lengthening it by appending "Wait" multiple times to the model's generation when it tries to end.
