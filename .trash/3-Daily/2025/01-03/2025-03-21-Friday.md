# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- 
- #j595/journal 
	- [Audio Models in the API - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXb0L16ISAc)
		- Better transcription model - ASR
		- Semantic VAD which would have been very useful for roadshow
		- New promptable text to speech model at openai.fm
	- Why are we thinking in terms of behavior trees and not agents? Should the decision making system not be CIK and just an agentic architecture? We are diving head first into GenAI for conversation/Siri but not for planning - why is that?
