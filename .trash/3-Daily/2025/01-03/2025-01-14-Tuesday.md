# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Tinkered with modernBERT to get basic embeddings from model - lost the change like an idiot because i forgot to save the python notebook
	- Started creating a [one-pager](https://quip-apple.com/ruFcAGL0pbAu) for [[notifications-lm]] 
- #j595/journal 
	- Lot of tinkering with Claude to get a quick daily notes viewer built with node & react - dev version works well but cant seem to get it to work when packaged up
	- Chatted with Cassie Spiker about [[side-hustle ideas#Crater Lake Airbnb]]

    - [x] grep and sed to remove Tasks completed and notes created from being subheaders 
    - [x] remove unused attachments & images obsidian 
    - [x] Ask Claude to build a simple viewer for your obsidian daily notes - looks at tags and put text underneath - an easier way for data view outside of obsidian
