	- Chatted with Xin about Moshi and audio encoders - its a wild wild west space where things are not as well settled as in the text or vision world apparently. Recommends these 2 papers as the more foundational bits:
		- [SoundStorm: Efficient Parallel Audio Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09636)
		- [SoundStream: An End-to-End Neural Audio Codec](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03312)
