	- Debugged [rdar://143157236](rdar://143157236)Â Conversation connection Agent is Reeeaaaalllllyyy slow with Teddy & Andreas
		- Andreas comes with his annoyingly sassy behavior yet again - he is a really shitty team player. Just had Cursor AI generate a bunch of plots for him and said everything is fine
		- I suggested some tests to measure latency by directly connecting device via ethernet to superserver and eliminating the WiFi network
		- Discoveries:
			- Internet sharing adds a ton of latency to the J310 even though themacbook connection to superserver is blazingly fast (1-5ms vs 100-300ms)
			- Turns out the BeatifulPlace wifi network is jammed - switched over to a new A25 network (from Pauley) and everything worked beautifully with 10x lower latency
	- Quick update on rdar://141230692 (Audio is missing at the end of Casper utterances) after some prompt testing:
		- Not adding any special pause instructions I got an audio drop after 38 consecutive prompts: this is better than last week where it was averaging every ~20 or so: could be indicative of OAI server bandwidth or purely random given its just one datapoint
		- Adding  "It is very important that you add a silent pause [pause] at the end of your response WITHOUT saying the word 'PAUSE'." to the system prompt:
		- Noticed that it vocalized "pause" at 3 times out of 10 in one run
		- Noticed some weird behavior where it repeated the audio twice (run 10 in video). I also retrieved the same audio file on superserver so most likely that came through from OAI
		- It still dropped the last audio token once (run 12 in video)
		- Tldr; still issues and might need further prompt tuning & other fiddling to get it to work reliably
