		-   **Workflows** are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.
		-  **Agents**, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.
		- When more complexity is warranted, workflows offer predictability and consistency for well-defined tasks, whereas agents are the better option when flexibility and model-driven decision-making are needed at scale. For many applications, however, optimizing single LLM calls with retrieval and in-context examples is usually enough.
		- The basic building block of agentic systems is an LLM enhanced with augmentations such as retrieval, tools, and memory. Our current models can actively use these capabilities—generating their own search queries, selecting appropriate tools, and determining what information to retain.	
		- Our suggestions for deciding on tool formats are the following:
			- Give the model enough tokens to "think" before it writes itself into a corner.
			- Keep the format close to what the model has seen naturally occurring in text on the internet.
			- Make sure there's no formatting "overhead" such as having to keep an accurate count of thousands of lines of code, or string-escaping any code it writes.
