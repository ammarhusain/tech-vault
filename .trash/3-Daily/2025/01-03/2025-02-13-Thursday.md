# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Teladoc charged me $100 for a stupid 10 min online visit with their doc - such a ripoff! Dont understand why they dont let patient know the visit cost ahead of time. [[health & fitness#Health Insurance]]. I thought visits are covered within Aetna because I do not remember being charged the last time.
