# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Dinner with Christina & Clement at home #social 
- #j595/journal 
	- #j595/perf 
		- Critical part of the TTS switcharoo for roadshow
		- Generated latency plots to make sure this is a valid path to take
		- Helped with TTS implementation and how it works with the rest of the system like expressive speaking
	- Not all the radars that are getting categorized as Bubbles latency are necessarily that. There is a lot of VAD triggering which is causing delayed responses. Its essentially breaking up input sentences.
		- Also function calls end up taking a while - can that be sped up?
