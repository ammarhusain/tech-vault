# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- 
- #j595/journal 
	- Looked into a few Roadshow Demo radars that Saari sent my way late last night
	- Eng sync in the morning where the demo'ed the roadshow - not much credit attribution from Saari. Looks like th e ML eval team is getting more importance now so may be I ll slowly back down & chill again.
	- Bunch of evangelizing for my dashboard: [Streamlit](http://j595-attention.corp.apple.com:8501/)
		- Added some more features to it like similarity score filtering and audio duration calculation + filtering
	- Lunch with Teddy, Andreas, Sri - they have their own internal gang. I. really dont give a shit in trying to fit in - Andreas is also tight in touch with Luke Winstrom who probably poisoned the well for me - just based on how I see Andreas behave toward me - does not include me in anything even though I am actively working on it or helping him with it
	- Got Zi the web UI to test AttentionLLM with objects model
