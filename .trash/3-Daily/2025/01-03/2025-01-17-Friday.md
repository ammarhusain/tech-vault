	- Helped Teddy debug logs for repeated utterances from Bubbles: [rdar://143075882](rdar://143075882) (22W4071v: Casper duplicates utterances in Homework (sometimes stuck in a loop of the same utterance))
		- Might be an issue with response status "incomplete" due to hitting "max_response_output_tokens"

	- Worked through [rdar://143157236](rdar://143157236) Conversation connection Agent is Reeeaaaalllllyyy slow - with him as well
		- Used Claude to analyze the timestamp deltas in the logs between when bubbles relay receives/sends the packet vs when the Casper client receives it\
