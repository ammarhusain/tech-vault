# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Iftar dinner with Pirates of SV group - lots of fun even though I was apprehensive of how it would turn out
- #j595/journal 
	- Sharing results from some Friday tinkering:

		- I tried using Googleâ€™s Gemini [Multimodal LiveAPI](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/multimodal-live) with a roadshow like setup to compare against our current pain points with Bubbles. This is an equivalent conversational model & API that was released in December last year. Though this one has direct vision input so the VLM call can be bypassed. I did not use the exact J595 prompts or tool call definitions for secrecy reasons so these are rough equivalents to test general behavior. Overall turns out in its current form Gemini is not much better and comes with its own set of challenges:
			- Audio can be garbly at times: especially when vocalizing math but also generally
			- It really struggles with tool calls: see attached video where the exact same prompt and tool call definition results in very random behaviors
			- Qualitatively latency feels pretty decent: may be better than Bubbles
			- Visual understanding is also pretty good and quite snappy
		- Code
		- `cd /Users/ammarh/j595/google-gemini/multimodal-live-api-web-console`
		- `npm install && npm start`
