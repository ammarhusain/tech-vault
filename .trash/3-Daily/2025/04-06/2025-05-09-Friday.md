# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- 
- #j595/journal 
	- Coffee chat with Catie Cuan - quite a name dropper
	- Chat with Sri: not much to do in [[memories-fc]]. It is mostly an agent within his broader multi agent system. 3 use cases in M0: 1) continue last conversation, 2) continue recent conversation, 3) continue communal conversation
		- Mostly need to implement conclusion generator
		- Had a long chat about multi agent and he showed me some of the multi agent chat roll outs he has been working on. Making it compatible with Bubbles and ConversationAgent.
		- For memories it might be writing another agent and a judge within his multi agent framework
		- Conclusion generator is literally taking in a base prompt and a multi turn conversation text and analysing whether the derived conclusion is good or not
		- Will be mostly around prompt generation - figure what memories to extract from conversation and how to inject it back into the conversation
	- Sheena K follow up [[side-hustle ideas]]
	- Setup Vision Pro
