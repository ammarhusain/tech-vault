##### TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily #j595/journal #travel/sweden 
	- Slow breakfast again and was supposed to go for the Majorna walking tour. Turns out I would have been the only one on the tour so decided to push it to tomorrow and go check out the islands instead.
	- Took tram to Saltholmen which took about 50 mins to get to and then immediately hopped on the ferry to Styrso (not sure about the spelling). Cute little island for a few day getaway. Would be interesting to rent a room here and laze around - less stimulating than being in a city. I did not realized when I hopped on that the island had 3 ports. I reached the more secluded port but it was a beautiful walk along the water to get to the other port where Cafe Oberliska was. Explored around for a little bit and then chilled at the cafe, reading & lazing around. Had a shrimp sandwich there and then took the ferry over to Brunna island. When I reached Brunna I realized the ferry frequency is not that much and the next one is 90 or so mins later. This was an even more charming and rustic Swedish island. I walked around exploring it and it was mostly houses & farms. Looked like people had their summer homes here. Found a small inn that served an coffee. Made fika here - coffee & vanilla canele. I realized that the other port at Brunna had a ferry at 3.26 pm which would take the longer scenic routes to the other southern islands while heading back to the mainland. Also it went from Saltholmen to Steniprem which is much closer from the hotel. The ferry ride back was super long though - almost 80ish mins so I felt pretty tired by the end of it and itching to get out. Explored around the port a little but then hopped on the bus back to the hotel.
	- Met with Sri & Ben for [[memories-fc]] and didnt get much time for dinner.
	- Went for the pub crawl near the Haga area - fun times. Chatted a lot with a few german students who were really nice & kind, Maria (a psychologist) etc. Took the last tram back but was an idiot reaching decision paralysis again on whether or not to order Burger King. Eventually I ordered but the sandwich never arrived.
