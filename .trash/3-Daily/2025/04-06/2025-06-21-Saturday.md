##### TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily #j595/journal #travel/sweden
	- Flight arrived early in Munich. Got out within 20 mins at 10am and walked around the airport waiting for Karna to show up ~10.30am.
	- Took train over to Marienplatz. Walked around that area and then cross through the LMU campus to go to English Garden. Thats the place Korbinian had mentioned a while ago to go tubing and laze by the river. Fun to do next time in Munich
	- Got lunch at a cafe near the garden - pretty hearty bulgur bowl. Took U-bahn back to Marienplatz and then caught the S-bahn to the airport which was about 30 mins.
	- Chilled at Lufthansa business class lounge for a bit before boarding for Gothenburg. Passed the F out on the flight. Missed the mean service but they offered me a little chocolate piece that I declined.
	- Pretty easy to get to Gothia towers - bus straight from the airport to Korsvagen across the street. It was a struggle finding food though because everything was closed and for some reason I did not feel like ordering room service. Ended up picking up wings & fries from McDonalds and chilled in the hotel room before turning in for the night.
