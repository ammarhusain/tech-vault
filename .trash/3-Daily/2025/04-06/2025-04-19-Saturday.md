		- Long breakfast with the full group - stuck around for a couple of hours just chatting about history etc
		- Packed up and then took horse carriage to the souk but decided to go on a Nile cruise instead - 30 min boat ride which was a lot of fun
		- Tarek, Sana & I left for Aswan while the other 3 had their bus for Hurghada
		- Reached Pyramisa around 5.30pm - got in and chilled a bit in the room. Tarek came over to the hotel but we decided to go back into town for dinner instead - picked up shawerma from a local Syrian spot 
		- Was stressing a bit about the super early start tomorrow morning which took away being present in the moment
