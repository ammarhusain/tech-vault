		- Tea in the morning with leftover bread from Mr Mousa. Checked out Civilization Museum - really insane to see the Mummies gallery. There were literally people who walked this land 4000-5000 years ago still in there. Some of them (may be Ramses II) fought with Moses so they lived in a time with an entirely different belief system than what any of us can imagine. Kind of shows how new some of our way of life & beliefs are in the grand scheme of things
		- Ate koshary at Abou Tarek (national dish of Egypt which was cool to try but very carb heavy and filling - just rice, pasta, lentils in a tomato sauce topped with fried onions)
		- Walked around Tahrir square after and got coffee around there. Walked over to Cairo tower in Zamalek - had a random street photographer take our pictures. Going up Cairo tower did not seem worth it though
		- Worked for a bit in the evening and then dinner at Mayyal Mayyal :)
