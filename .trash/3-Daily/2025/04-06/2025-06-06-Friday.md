##### TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- 
- #j595/journal 
	- Set up the [[memories-fc]] judge and got the judge pipeline working with Gala's help
		- python -m judging.example_auto_judge artifacts/2025-06-05_18-26-53/casper/conversation_agent/scenario_20250605_182717.json
			- The scenario file is the last file in the artifacts directory that contains the full simulated interaction between user & device
			- Had to make a few changes to the LLMJudge auto_judge mostly around how different MessageTypes are parsed out
	- Running context or recall judge
		  python -m judging.memory_agent_judge context /Users/ammarh/j595/palazzo-memory-ml/artifacts/2025-06-05_18-26-53/casper/conversation_agent/scenario_20250605_182717.json 
		  python -m judging.memory_agent_judge recall /Users/ammarh/j595/palazzo-memory-ml/artifacts/2025-06-0
		  5_18-26-53/casper/conversation_agent/scenario_20250605_182717.json
	- Trying to setup Claude code with Apple Floodgate proxy - [Andreas slack thread](https://a1350286.slack.com/archives/C04AJ7EBJL8/p1748886185080259)
		- Tried this [repo](https://github.pie.apple.com/dgorbik/claude-floodgate-proxy) but it modified /etc/hosts to route the ap.anthropic requests to a local server - will need to fix it if I want to use anthropic directly instead of floodgate. Works well though has rate limits.
