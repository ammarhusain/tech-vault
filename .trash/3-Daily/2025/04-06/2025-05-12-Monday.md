##### TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- HOA huddle outside Bjoern to review sliding material
	- Visited Sheena & Eugene in HAyward to checkout Parkers cookies facility [[side-hustle ideas]]
- #j595/journal 
	- Productive day getting Behavior Tree LLM generation bot working - vibe coding visualization got wonky so had to look back in git history to prod the LLM for fixing it up. So important to constantly commit!
