##### TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- 
- #j595/journal 
	- [[memories-fc]] - seems like there is suddenly an urgency to get the memory eval pipeline up & running. Niharika just seems to be a glorified EPM working on schedules, sponsor meetings & leadership without having her own vision on anything
		- Need to create a replay judge rather than an auto_judge. Also use an AudioJudge (similar to roadshow) than an LLMJudge that is more for reviewing transcripts.
		- LLMJudge → Utterance / Replay → AudioJudge
		- Copy safety or utterance judge (type of replay judgement)
		- Command to run a judge
			- python -m pytest critic/auto/test_scenario.py --scenario_dir /Users/ammarh/j595/palazzo-memory-ml/artifacts/2025-06-05_18-26-53/casper/conversation_agent -n10 --judge base.conversation.friendly base.conversation.safety --count 10
		- Command to run a simulation
			- python -m orchestration.encom.simulation params/encom/memory.yaml
