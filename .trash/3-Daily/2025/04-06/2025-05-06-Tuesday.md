# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily

- #j595/journal 
	- Chat with Greg [[action sequencing-m0]]
		- How do we get the LLM to call the tool reliably
		- Would be super useful to have a local LLM generate a behavior tree -> "Hey look at the paper"
		- Have a way for user to verbally command the device point in different spots
			- Roadshow was also hardcoded locations
		- Certain function calls -> map to fixed behavior trees "look at the homework"
			- We should also have facility for dynamic behavior trees that may be slightly modify one or more existing ones: "look at the paper on the left"
		- Supergoals example: "User wants casper to play podcast", "Is what I am wearing today appropriate for dinner tonight"
		- This could be a "behavior_planner('goal')" function call and we can restrain it to be timebound and completed within a certain tick count or interrupt it after some time
