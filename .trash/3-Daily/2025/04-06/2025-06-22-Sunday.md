##### TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily #j595/journal #travel/sweden 
	- Attended some of the HCII courses but they were boring AF. Got a nice chicken sandwich at the cafe across the hotel. Mostly vibe coded through the sessions. I was interested in attending an afternoon workshop but it was supposedly "invite only" - was super annoying. Decided to explore Gothenburg instead of wasting time at the conference. Networked a bit over the afternoon refreshments break
	- 30 mins upper body workout
	- Went over to checkout Haga Nygata but everything was pretty dead because of Mid Summer. Tried to get food at a cafe there but the waiter did not show up for a while.
	- Went for dinner at Heaven23 in Gothia Tower 1 - waitress was Linnea a masters student in sustainability at Chalmers university. Dinner was great and in a good relaxed mood overall
