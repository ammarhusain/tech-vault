		- Coffee & brioche at Eden - went to Ras al Husain ziyarat in Old Cairo. Reached around dhuhr namaaz so prayed over there and then spent a bunch of time inside: was really peaceful to be in there
		- Walked around Khan al khalili market for a while after and bought some souvenirs & pashmina etc. Went for maulatena Zainab ziyarat around asar namaaz. Had a tasty shawerma right outside on the square.
		- Picked up Chinese from Joy Luck for dinner - it was not very good
