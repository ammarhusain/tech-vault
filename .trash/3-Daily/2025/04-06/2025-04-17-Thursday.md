		- Packed up from the liveaboard, said bye to everyone and then head for the Go Bus stop to go to Luxor. The bus took >5 hours and we reached Luxor around 3.30pm. It was chaos at the bus stand where taxi drivers were heckling us non stop.
		- Head over to a restaurant by the Nile for late lunch and then walked by Luxor temple for sunset eventually ending up in the souk - crazy amounts of heckling and aggressive store vendors.
		- Chilled at the Temple hotel rooftop in the evening
