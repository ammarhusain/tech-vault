##### TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- 
- #j595/journal 
	- Action space meeting for BT task planner [[action sequencing-m0]]
		- Intent based subaction block is what the task planner agent produces
		- [x] Josh shared a preliminary list of CIK action space - need to get it from him  [completion:: 2025-06-06]
		- There could be a Say action block with high level blurb that then CAD can vocalize
		- Might also want to have a PlayAnimation action type with a blessed set of animations that the task planner is allowed to use given the context of the intent
	- Chat with Sri on [[memories-fc]]
		- Palazzo-memory-ml repo is all the multi agent & eval stuff
			- multi_agent_casper directory - create an agent and inject it there
			- Participants are actors in a scene - could or could not have LLM
				- Casper is also another participant in the scene
		- Memory would need both an agent and a judge
		- Tasks for M0:
			- Write a conclusion generator (Dmitry)
			- Take 5 golden conversations and build a judge such that they pass all of them (Ammar) - ask Gala for help
				- Compatible with critic - replay judging is the context of each agent; transcript judge - looks at grid log file that has the full log of everything
			- Take sim city and then generate 100 examples using that judge (Ammar)
			- Iterate on these
		- Commands:
			- Start a simulation
			python -m orchestration.encom.simulation params/encom/default.yaml
			- Start an interactive simulation:
			python -m orchestration.encom.simulation params/encom/interactive.yaml
