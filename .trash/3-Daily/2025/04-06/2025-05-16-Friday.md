##### TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- 
- #j595/journal 
	- [[action sequencing-m0]]
		- Been chugging along getting the Behavior Tree Generator and Engine to work properly. Changing it to an event driven one (after chatting with Josh) has made it a pain to debug. I cant tell if the tree configuration is wrong or theres a bug in the BT engine
		- Overall Gemini-2.5-pro has been better for more complex tasks and algorithmic innovation
			- Claude-2.7 seems to fix and revert the same things over and over again. It also seems to make changes everytime for the fuck of it unlike Gemini-2.5 that sometimes just analyses your code and pushes back on the assertion that a fix is needed which i like
			- Gemini-2.5-pro is super verbose though. All its explanations are extremely long and confusing. Claude-2.7-sonnet is a lot better at concise explanations. Gemini also seems to keep complementing itself in the reasoning traces.
		- Gemini-2.5-pro does better in producing the right behavior tree (takes a lot longer though)
