##### TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Got really pissed at Huzefa since he was supposed to drop me to the shuttle but ended up going to Peets in Stonestown and did not come back until I called him a few times. Missed the bus of course so ended up driving down.
- #j595/journal 
	- Meeting with Sri & Dmitry on [[memories-fc]]
		- Plan is to inject full 2 weeks history for M0 instead of rely on conversation summarization - give everything to the LLM for the most high fidelity history
			- Sys Prompt (*You are a friendly ...*) + 2 weeks convo + holistic summary (*This person is an eng ...*) + new convo (*"whats the weather"*)
		- Dmitry has the agent scaffolding code in place and a way to run everything for evals
		- Task is to build out a judge - few shot the 5 examples from the HI golden dataset
			- Reach out to Gala - could repurpose the utterance judge
