		- Last full day in Cairo. Breakfast at Zooba in Maadi, then went to Cairo Citadel. Masjid was cool but got lost in the Military museum which was inside the Ali Pasha palace
		- Checked out the Hanging Church and then took metro over to near Tahrir square. Karam el Shaam restaurant was closed but found a really good Syrian shawarma place nearby.
		- Chilled at Airbnb for a bit - went for Magrib namaaz to the masjid and prayed with imamat - was really nice to experience the slow deliberative pace of praying without all the bohri overhead.
		- Walked over to Tawlet Yvonne near the Koupa juice place for sheesha. Hung till midnight until it shut.
