	- Ammar and I went to the Explorer's lounge to work for a bit but i felt sick due to the rocking.
	- We got lunch at Sabortini - some pizza.
	- Went to the room, packed up and read for a bit while Ammar worked
	- We went for a stretch class and then to the hot tub for a bit
	- Showered and enjoyed the glaciers at College Fjords from our balcony. It was stunning and we watched ice cavings from the harvard glacier.
