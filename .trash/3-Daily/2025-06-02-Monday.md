##### TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- It was a sea day with cruising in Glacier bay NP
	- We got breakfast at Bordeaux and went to the balcony to prep for the first glacier Margerie.
	- The rangers had come on board and set upa. visitor centre at the Explorer lounge
	- We viewd the glaier from our balcony for a bit but the gujrati group was being loud and vile. So we migrated to bhai's balcony to view the glacier.
	- After that we went to deck 14 to get some ramen that they were serving and some pizza while we waited for the second glacier
	- Turns out we didn't really go into the canal for the second glacier due to bad weather.
	- Watched a show about the NP at the theatre
	- We chilled in bhai's room for a bit
	- Watched the rangers leave
	- Went to the hot tub but it was really cold so i went back down quite early to shower.
	- They announced that it was dress to impress night so everyone dressed up for dinner
	- We got a quick drink at wheelhouse and went for dinner
	- The boat got incredibly rocky due to bad weather and everyone fell sea sick.
