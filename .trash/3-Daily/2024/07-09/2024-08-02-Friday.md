# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- #crawlspace Chatted with Jakub
		- Good idea: had a small iframe code that clients/ publishers can put on their webside to indicate that this data can be licensed on [[Crawlspace]]
		- He mentioned Auth0 gets very expensive but we could may be use it to onboard users and then give them API keys for ongoing access. There is also AWS Cognito which I need to dig more into
		- I need to look into how sign on flow works in Webflow - Memberstack or Wized
