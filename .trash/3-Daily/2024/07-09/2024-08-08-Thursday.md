# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Chatted with Jakub about integrating the new finetuned model. Tl;dr
		- Augment the AttentionLLM proto to output high, medium, low scores for each entity
		- Jakub can help map these entity scores to some intrinsics function that can be run within AK - thinking of doing something straightforward like a linear time decay with the score adjusted everytime the AttentionLLM responds. It could be like a sawtooth function with jumps in score at every LLM response moment.
		- We need a way within the AttentionTestApp to zero out the device when all scores are low/zero.
