# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Banged my head trying to get the demo working. Ran into a bunch of perf issues
		- Was trying to get the "ambient" LLM label piped into the AttentionTestApp behavior where it just pitches down to sleep
		- Had to abandon that altogether - just got a basic demo working with just looking at each other by naming them isReferenced
	- Demo went very meh - didn't seem like anyone was excited by it.
