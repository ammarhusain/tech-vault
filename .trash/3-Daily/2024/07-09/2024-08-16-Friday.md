# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Was highly anticipating the stock vest yesterday. After taxes seems so much less than what I mentally had made it out to be:
		- ![[2024-08-16-Friday-2024-08-16.png]]
	-  Crossfit workout which always makes me feel great - went to Costco in the evening after that
	- Watched Triple Frontier movie with popcorn & rotisserie chicken
- #crawlspace Jakub chat
	- Recommended him to use Docker images over CI/CD & lambda pipelines that just operate on zip files of code
	- He mentioned parsing sites like reuters is difficult because they just return javascript code that needs to get rendered. So the scraper will need to have a Chrome browser engine baked in that can take the code and render it inside a lambda/EC2 instance
	- Links also can be tricky from javascript because with html pages you just fetch the href - but in javascript its unclear how the links to other sites are specified.
	- [x] #todo I need to checkout how Applebot scrapes through Reuters and other news sites in Annex - check how links from javascript pages work.  [completion:: 2024-08-16]
	- Is there innovation in the scrapers themselves like AppleBot, GoogleBot etc that we would get push back from AI companies who would want to scrape for themselves vs curate data post facto? Somme innovations involved in
		- How wide and deep to search through the linked pages - we do a naive approach where it indexes every single linked page
		- Most scrapers use Pupeteer to control a webpage like the Captcha human verification - may be different ways to handle that content or content that is behind paywalls or login checks.
	- Jakub can set up Auth0 - better than AWS Cognito for authentication. We can do this while I am in London
		- Also do a product walkthrough of onboarding a website for crawling
	- Google has a site verification console here. Found it through my Webflow site settings SEO tab - [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console?hl=en&resource_id=sc-domain:ammarh.io). It used Cloudflare to somehow verify

	- Downloaded and tried out the Warp terminal
	- Luke Winstrom is leaving :D!!
	- Mostly meetings - no real progress today
