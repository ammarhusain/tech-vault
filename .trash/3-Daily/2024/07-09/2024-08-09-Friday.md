# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal
	- Fixed the issue with converting SmolLM to gguf (forgot to update the script name)
	- Finetuned and evaluated a SmolLM model with the last TinyLlama dataset. Seems to perform very well surprisingly - need to make sure there are no bugs in my code by using the streamlit UI
	- Got the first of N integration PRs ready - need to check on device but can't seem to get AmbientExperience working after flashing a new AttentionKit-all
		- PR #2 - modify the AttentionLLMState proto to annotate entity score for each entity
		- PR #3 - enable audio sampling
	- Got the updated Sunscreen working and seeing streaming messages now
	- #journal/daily
		- Came across: [LLMs-from-scratch/ch07 - Direct Preference Optimization RL algorithm](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/blob/main/ch07/04_preference-tuning-with-dpo/dpo-from-scratch.ipynb) - interesting to do a walkthrough over #tinker_short. The full course would be fun & educational as well if I had time.
			- Do at least chapters 5,6 & 7
		- Crossfit at noon
		- Signed up LinkedIn Premium to start sending out leads messages for #crawlspace
