	- Walked on Copacabana beach for a bit
	- Ubered to Ipanema to go to Delirium cafe - nice Prato like place to get healthy salads & plates. I got the quinoa salad with curried chicken
	- It started raining as we walked to LePetit cafe - nice cozy coffee shop to work from.Got a bunch of stuff done there until 6.30pm
	- Walked back to Copacaban ~40mins and picked up some tofu & mushrooms from Zona Sul
	- Went to check if the artist was selling her paintings but did not find them because of the rain
	- Sana cooked dinner while did a quick home workout.
	- We ate in while watching Elite Squad 2 - figured out how to get it from the Canadian VPN
	- Went to get some gelato and stood at the beach watching the huge waves until late at night.
