# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily #travel/brazil 
	- Woke up groggy at midnight and rushed to pack everything up for our flight to Panama.Â 
	- Was hoping to pick up a magnet and do the money exchange but the Manaus airport had absolutely nothing on the international side of the terminal. I should have really picked up the magnet when I saw one and not wait until the very end to see if I could get something better.
	- When we reached Panama City Sana was not able to get in with a transit visa because her green card had less than 6 months to expire - quite a bummer because we were both excited to explore the canal & the city
	- We just ended up chilling and working the entire day at the lounge in terminal 2.
	- Got my CA Umri tax filing done for Q3-2023, reviewed tax returns that Tanya prepared, filled out chase dispute response and wrote my perf self assessment.
