# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Fixed the AttentionKit unit tests that my AttentionLLMState proto change broke
	- Tried the live viewing sigmon messages in sunscreen - it works when everything is connected
	- I discovered that physicalObjects query in WorldStateCollator does not work when device is in Everest mode
	- Chat with Marisa:
		- Dont think she really has big use cases for Internal Judgment really 
		- One big use case is with giving attention to virtual entities that are on screen
		- I pitched to her to think more broadly on how the Internal Judgment LLM can fill in the gaps before the big Conversational LLM comes back with its decisions.
	- My Obsidian repo had not gotten pushed in a month because of 3 large videos that I added to the vault.  I had to add them to the gitignore and remove them from git history using this command
``` 
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path/to/large_file" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```
