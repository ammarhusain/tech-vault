# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- [[meeting notes]] with martin - mentioned to him about the politics & jakub
	- drove into the office to try stuff on the lotus unit
	- audio does not work initially - have to run MotifTools audio -s once before it starts working with out it. with it the audio messages get duplicated because both the audio client & peopleawarenessd are publishing audio then,

- #journal/daily 
	- Chat with Alberto #crawlspace 
		- Surprise VC - go all in rather than passively do it
		- Good to have a pitch deck - may be make a cartoonish explainer video to send people
		- Present the problem from POV of the buyer. There is a lot of uncertainty for big companies - liability etc.
			- Big cos dont wanna buy energy made out of coal - they are worried about public outrage; they are interested in virtue signaling
			- Public stigma will remain of using free data
			- We give them clarity of what data they are using - remove the liability & hesitation for companies to train more / bigger model
		- Biggest challenge will be elsewhere - not in the tech space; more of a go to market challenge & a legal challenge
			- Not incremental but will need a quantum leap
		- Try to get someone as a pillar who can keep knocking on doors of the industry giants
		- VC contacts can really help getting the connections to the people making the contracts
		- academia.edu is a good example for precedent - they were trying to replace big publishing houses like Elsevier etc
		- No one will question the tech - they will assume its doable or done
			- Think about adding a moat - VCs need to see a monopolizing business plan
		- Startups as customers can be flaky; they have no money; they have so many other problems
		- You wanna start having the next 10 moves figured out - need to go in BOLD
			- Everyday you need to know HOW YOU GET BIG
			- Cant be: "we ll figure out the rest of our plan once XYZ happens"
		- Knows a super angel Howard Chao - legal background, organizes retreats in santa cruz
			- Also knows COO at academia.edu - Mitch Fox; does biz dev at Airbnb; had a startup & sold it to Intuit
			- Prescott Wilson - was at a VC fund: can have a friendly chat (not pitching)
