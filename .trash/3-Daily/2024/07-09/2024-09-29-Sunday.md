# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- C3 class in the morning; got a haircut; chilled at Philz and booked ticket from PMO-FCO and FCO-SFO
	- Practiced OneWheel at Safeway playground. I should have updated the firmware and made the wheel ready before heading over instead of wasting 20 mins there standing around.
	- Finished reading Cat's Cradle - Kurt Vonnegut
		- Trying to wrap my head around the point of the book - existential angst and the meaningless of life
		- Bokononism was something of a tongue-on-cheek representation of religion as a whole. It is a collection of lies that people put faith into to give them purpose in life. The core ideas of existentialism are that life has no meaning, so we as humans must find our own. Existentialism came as part of the rubble of World War II and the Holocaust when the value of life was being questioned. The events that transpired in the book could be seen as analogous to those and the underlying idea of the true meaninglessness of life then comes through.
