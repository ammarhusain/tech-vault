# TOP-OF-MIND
- #aiml 
	- Thoughts on [[karpathy]]-4o1 as inference time compute from a newsletter (the actual LLM might be smaller but it does more reasoning)
		- > What OpenAI did was get the o1 models to go through just this sort of “thinking” process, producing hidden thinking tokens before giving a final answer. In doing so they revealed another scaling law - the longer a model “thinks,” the better its answer is. Just like the scaling law for training, this seems to have no limit, but also like the scaling law for training, it is exponential, so to continue to improve outputs, you need to let the AI “think” for ever longer periods of time.
	- Do a small hands on tutorial in python to grasp concepts of DPO and PPO in RL #tinker_short 
	- Good computer vision library to get up and running quickly [GitHub - roboflow/supervision: We write your reusable computer vision tools](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision)

	- Polestar early termination quote came upto $17k whereas to continue the lease to full term is $15k. Might as well use it for another year or so and try to get another quote later.

	- [Superserver llama-70B](https://superserver.corp.apple.com:9124/) - Andreas hosted model on A100 GPUs
	- [Interlinked](https://interlinked.apple.com/chat) - Langchain like library at Apple to built. internal apps using AI. Would be interesting to prototype something with it - Quip based QA system, Code explain tool using heavenly repos #j595/idea #tinker_short 
	- Made an AttentionKit submission
	- Have an LLM generate behaviors - or motion primitives from what Victor used to create the search behavior #j595/idea
