# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Discovered that my synthetic data distribution was way off - had only 1k isReferences, 14k isEngaged, 15k isRejected - engaged & references should have been swapped
	- Updated all devices - Tried to get AttentionTestApp running
- #journal/daily 
	- Feeling a bit sick. Worked out in the morning but ended up WFH
