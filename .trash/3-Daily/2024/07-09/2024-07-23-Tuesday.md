# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Interesting small LLM to potentially finetune for [[attentionkit-fc]] [SmolLM - blazingly fast and remarkably powerful](https://huggingface.co/blog/smollm)
	- Came across this interesting [Rephrasing paper from Apple](https://x.com/pratyushmaini/status/1752337225097076809) - they pretty much take the noisy uncurated training data and use a small Rephrasing LLM model to generate N different ways of saying the same thing to produce synthetic examples that are closely tied to a corresponding real example
	- Took the entire morning to get in the zone - cleared emails, did grunt work
	- Worked on #crawlspace landing page for a while
	- Got the attentionLLM working on Everest; implemented zeroing out the attention scores when the LLM outputs "ambient". Turns out the device does not go to zero pose / sleep when all entities have zero attention scores - Need to find out some way to handle this
