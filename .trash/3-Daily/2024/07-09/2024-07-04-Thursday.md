# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily #travel/brazil 
	- Breakfast buffet at Novotel. Manati driver picked us up sharp at 9am as we scrambled to get set to go.
	- An hour drive and then another 40 mins by boat to the lodge. It looked really nice and the chalet felt quite luxurious with hammocks to chill right outside.
	- Met our guide Limaas we were sipping on our welcome drinks : cupuacu juice (sour taste).He shared a bunch of info about the lodge. There was another gujju family that would be with us in the English speaking group.
	- We lazed around the lodge and I took a nice hour long nap after lunch which felt great. Got some coffee after and then got ready to set out for our first excursion.
	- We went piranha fishing in the flooded forest and then went around for a bit trying to spot wildlife. Reached the floating house for sunset where we jumped in the water for a nice swim. Met this Nigerian guide Frank over there who took a bunch of nice pictures for us with the sunset.
	- Got back to the lodge, showered and head over for dinner. Got some caipis to celebrate our anniversary and first night at the lodge.
