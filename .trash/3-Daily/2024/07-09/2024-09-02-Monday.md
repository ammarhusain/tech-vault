# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Chill lazy morning - wrote a few book reviews on GoodReads and scoped out my next book (Animal Farm?)
	- Spoke with family for a while with & after breakfast.
	- Was thinking about going for Pilates but started feeling lazy so skipped.
	- Ended up in a situation not knowing what to do to spend our weekend time. I need to polish up a list of activities
	- Got a beer at Zeitgeist, then tandoori chicken with naan at Pakwaan and head to watch Deadpool 3 at Alamo Drafthouse
	- Came home and read Cats Cradle on the couch for a bit.
	- Pho for dinner watching Ted Lasso - hit the bed early ~10am.
