# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Trying to get AttentionLLM working on the Lotus unit
		- Best way to get faceprints registered is to look at the Identity in MotifTools visualize and then search for the full UUID in suncore-> can add the corresponding name that way
		- Deploy code to device via ssh using roots
		- Killed the Mixtral model running on server because it was getting jammed up. The new audio sampling changes went into the build so we are pinging the server a lot now from every device.
		- You need the base connected to display for Motif tracks to work in Lotus mode - make sure `sigmonctl stream --channels /joint_feedback` is being published
		- Motif audio seems to crash after about 20 mins still!!
		- The base connected on Lotus 41 keeps disconnecting and Motif stops working!!\
		- Face Prints are not consistently detected in Motif!!
	- Chatted with Madison on a plan forward to integrate the LLM output
		- Makes sense to split the isReferenced and isRejected into their own intrinsics
		- Could check out the isApproaching PR in AttentionKit repo to see all the places the intrisics need to be updated
