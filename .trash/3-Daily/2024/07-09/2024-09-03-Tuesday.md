# TOP-OF-MIND
- #crawlspace 
	- Off the shelf web scrapers / crawlers that we could use as well?
		- [Welcome – Nextra](https://getscraping.com/docs)
		- [GitHub - mendableai/firecrawl: 🔥 Turn entire websites into LLM-ready markdown or structured data. Scrape, crawl and extract with a single API.](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl)
		- [GitHub - unclecode/crawl4ai: 🔥🕷️ Crawl4AI: Open-source LLM Friendly Web Crawler & Scrapper](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai)
	- Looks like there are mixed results on what sales platform to use - LinkedIn Sales Navigator, CogniSim, Apollo, ZoomInfo  - [Anyone have insight into LinkedIn Sales Navigator? : r/marketing](https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/se5z7e/anyone_have_insight_into_linkedin_sales_navigator/)
		- Probably worth going with whatever is the cheapest
		- So far I am seeing very low response rates with InMail so may be better to direct email or phone call instead
- #j595/journal 
	- Slow unfocused day
	- Compiled [instructions for Mik](https://quip-apple.com/bqF8A55PyICR) to run the AttentionLLM for perf testing
	- Drove back to SF with Victor
	- Good yoga sesh for an hour at 8pm
