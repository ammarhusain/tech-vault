	- [How might LLMs store facts | Chapter 7, Deep Learning - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-Jl0dxWQs8)
		- Majority of the Transformer params are in the MLP layers rather than in Attention
		- ![[2024-09-06-Friday-2024-09-06.png]] [[karpathy]]
		- Interesting section in the end on superposition / sparse autoencoders and why transformers scale so well with parameter count
			- The idea is that in an N-dimensional embedding space you can fit an order of magnitude more vectors than N if you relax the contraint that all vectors are orthogonal to each other. So vector can be 89-91 deg from each other and that packs in a lot more vectors (where each vector represents a part of a concept). Therefore some combination of these vectors illustrates a full concept and is stored efficiently within the transformer hidden dimensions. So an MLP dim of 49k can potentially represent over 490k concepts in that one layer. Now stack these up with multiple transformer blocks and that is a ton of information.

	- Upgraded iOS back to Crystal 18.0 since it broke Photos & Watch sync - hopefull gets fixed
