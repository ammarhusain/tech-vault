# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Merged [conversationReferenced PR](https://github.pie.apple.com/heavenly/AttentionKit/pull/103)
	- Chatted with Anton about Memories in FC4
	- Cant get AgentMemory running -> therefore WSC is not giving snapshots to AttentionLLM
	- Posted a question about getting Project Codes mapped to devices:
		- Conductor.swe.apple.com is one option
		- From Patrick Metcalfe:
			- If you have Xcode installed, all this information ships with Xcode and can be grepped for using SQL: `xcrun --sdk iphoneos.internal embedded_device_map -header -query "SELECT * FROM \"Targets\" WHERE \"Target\" LIKE '%d9%' ORDER BY \"Target\" LIMIT 300 OFFSET 0;" | column -t -s '|'`
			- ![[xcode-devices.sh]]
			- And if you’d like to open the DB file directly in TablePlus (which I do because my SQL is awful) then the file is here:  `$(xcrun --show-sdk-platform-path --sdk iphoneos.internal)/usr/local/standalone/firmware/device_map.db`
