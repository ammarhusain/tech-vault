# TOP-OF-MIND

	- Noticed that I get 2 final audio message for the same utterances - pinged audio people and built a simple checker for it

- #journal/daily 
	- Met with Tarin & Nishanth for lunch at their coworking space. #social. Chatted about SPC - they said itâ€™s useless and caliber not very good
