# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Created last week and last month queries in dataview for aggregating logs
	- Fixed the issue which was causing AmbientExperience and AttentionTestApp to crash when installing AttentionKit-all to device
		- Problem was that my xcode workspace contained CIK project which was causing some weirdness. I guess workspaces suck in xcode - just use individual projects directly.
		- Had to wipe out my entire device (erase + nvram cleanup) and updated both device & xcode to latest
	- Discovered that now in Everest mode I cannot get MotifAudio but have to get the speech through Everest text boxes. Jeez - another breaking change underneath that I missed comms on!
		- Makes testing multi agent interactions pretty complicated
