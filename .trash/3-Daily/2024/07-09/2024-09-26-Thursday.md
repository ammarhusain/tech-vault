# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Memories & Objectives Architecture Review
		- Multi user interactions are a big open question
		- Paul made a good point after about perception running within exclave and whether we would be allowed to ship out derived memories from it - follow up with saari?
		- There is also the case where attention gets tied to memory by user preferences ("dont look at me")
	- Got device in a working state again but LLM server was down. Requested static IP for it. Rebased the experimental TestApp visualization branch to main with my merged intrinsics changes (conversationalReferenced and conversationalRejected) 
- #journal/daily 
	- Madison mentioned that you can take a medical leave of absence that you do not necessarily give any justification to Apple - Sedgwick handles it and they just need a doctors note. She had taken an unpaid 6 weeks where benefits stop and so does stock vesting.
