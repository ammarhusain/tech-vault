# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Got Jakubs help in getting the AttentionTestApp working (sort of). Workspace with multiple projects messes up XCode so had to create a new one with just AttentionKit; also have to Copy To Device Attentionkit-All first to get the library changes
	- Chatted with Sri - he had a good idea about AttentionLLM modifying stage notes with user attention preference (eg: "dont look at me") which the conversational llm can consume
		- Kept talking about lex & yacc parsers. Sent me this [PLY](https://github.com/dabeaz/ply) library
	- Manuels worlstate collator seems to hang in returning the prompt; reverted to the old change and swapped out with the finetuned llm (not quite in a working state though)
