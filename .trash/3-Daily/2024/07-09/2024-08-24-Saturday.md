# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Standup Paddleboarding clinic in Alameda. Was super chill and surprised myself on being able to stand up and stay up easily.
		- Julia (instructor) recommended learning Wing foiling instead of Windsurfing - less gear need and still fun to learn
	- Picked up Hotboys chicken because it seemed nearby and traffic home was rough - did not really need to
		- #journal/meditations You end up wasting more time trying to avoid doing something than if you just did it
	- Bear trim at Louies in Castro - was meh
	- Went to Birba to drink wine and read Banana Republic book
		- Started chatting with Luke Seddon & Emily Hamilton there - interesting people. 
		- #journal/meditations Should have traded contact info since we were chatting so much. Do not be afraid to be bold when you meet like minded people that you want to keep in touch with. ALWAYS BIAS towards trading contact info.
