# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily #travel/brazil 
	- Checked out Copacabana fort in the morning. Got a good brunch at the Colombo bakery in there.
	- Went to Casa Dos Das for a bit of afternoon work - nothing too crazy.
	- Sugarloaf mountain in the evening. It was really packed & crowded. Should have bought a ticket online which could have saved us tons of time. Got pretty frustrated at the lines for the cable cars. W barely made it for sunset at the first mountain. Explored sugarloaf for a while after - waited for the crowds to die down to get back down. It was way past 7 and a lot later than what we anticipated on getting back.Â 
	- Picked up the art work, couple of jerseys and a magnet soivenir
	- Packed up our bags and tried optimizing for Manati by splitting up our bags - kind of a waste to do that
	- Got a drink at the restaurant underneath to celebrate our anniversary - took an uber to Copacabana beach to watch the last 15 mins of the Brazil Colombia Copa match - good end to the time in Rio
