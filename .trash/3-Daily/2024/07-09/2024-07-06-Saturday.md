# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily #travel/brazil 
	- I woke up at 6.30am and went kayaking by myself for a while. It got pretty hot with the sun out but was fun still. Reached pretty close to the boat house though did not see any dolphins
	- After breakfast we went out for a canoe trip - just the two of us with the 2 guides. Spotted a few pink dolphins which was super cool!
	- Chilled and showered at the lodge, enjoyed some lunch and then coffee after lunch. Took the canoe out by ourselves before the afternoon excursions. Was a lot harder to handle without the guides this time around.
	- For the afternoon excursion we went further down the river to see some big tree there. Spotted a sloth, several monkeys and 2 macaws flying in the distance. We were joined by 4 new people. It would have been so much better to do the excursions with this newer group than the gujju family the last day and a half.
	- Sunset at the floating house again with a few beers and a swim with dolphins nearby again
