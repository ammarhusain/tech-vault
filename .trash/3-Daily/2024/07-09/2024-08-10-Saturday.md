# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Alemany farmers market after a nice & easy breakfast at home
	- Crossed a garage sale on the way back and turns out there were several all over Bernal Heights so we drove around the neighborhood and checked out a few. Bought a frame of the moon landing.
	- Picked up some kheema & fish from the Mission meat market. Goat there was half the price (6.99) compared to the place we stopped by in Oakland before.
	- Made ceviche for lunch
	- Tried to fix the front door lock from jamming
	- Had chai, shaved, showered and head over to Adil Maleehes for dinner & barbecue around 5pm #social 
		- Stayed there for ~5 hours just hanging out and playing code names after dinner.
