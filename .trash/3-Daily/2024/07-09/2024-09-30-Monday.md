	- Interesting comparison of various LLM inference engines: [Face-off of 6 maintream LLM inference engines : r/LocalLLaMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ff79bh/faceoff_of_6_maintream_llm_inference_engines/)
	- **Larger quantized models** generally outperform smaller high-precision models, as shown in a [graph comparing quantization vs. perplexity](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1441jnr/k_quantization_vs_perplexity/). A **70B model** at 4-bit quantization typically surpasses an **8B model** at full precision due to more internal token relationship representations.

	- Tried setting up Lotus to run Attention LLM demo
		- Audio did not work as usual because assets were not downloading - installed an old root instead for now.
