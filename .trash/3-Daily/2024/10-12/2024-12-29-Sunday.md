# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Woke up and did a bunch of stock research to invest 25k into. It was fun to dive in & think rather than impulsively buy.
	- Took our time in the morning watching news on the new TV, ate some eggs for breakfast and set out for the Crater Lake cabin ~9.45am
	- Drove for 3-4 hours straight until the EV needed a top up. It was a game on where to charge and whether it would survive all the way to Anderson. Made it all the way and got incredibly lucky with the charger there - had to wait only a couple of mins. The line grew a lot lot longer by the time we got done shopping at Safeway. Quick lunch at Puerto Vallarta restaurant and head north. Made another stop in Weed, CA as the tire pressure was low. Ended up charging right where the air machine was which was again incredibly lucky.
	- Reached the cabin around 6pm - very nice & cozy indeed. Made some stir fry and enjoyed an evening in starting on season 2 of squid games..
