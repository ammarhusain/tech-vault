# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Morning open gym workout - did 5 weighted exercises - backsquats, push press, bench press, tricep DB, DB bicep curls. Absentmindedly dropped a 5lb plate on my toe which really hurts
	- Feeling very blah today because thanksgiving shutdown is over and I felt like I did not do anything or maximize the days off. This India trip really made it tough to plan but at the same time we wanted to reserve this Thanksgiving for family time - not sure if that was really the best idea - could have traveled somewhere perhaps? #journal/meditations 
	- Went to Stonestown with Sana even though I initially thought I'd skip it - I really should have skipped it. The mall was depressing me
	- Came home and spent an hour or so packing - it was not too tiring. I think I have a decent system in place now
