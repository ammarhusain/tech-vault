	- [Merge Large Language Models with mergekit](https://huggingface.co/blog/mlabonne/merge-models) --- [GitHub - arcee-ai/mergekit: Tools for merging pretrained large language models.](https://github.com/arcee-ai/mergekit?tab=readme-ov-file#mixture-of-experts-merging)
		- Model merging is a technique that combines two or more LLMs into a single model. It's a relatively new and experimental method to create new models for cheap (no GPU required). Model merging works surprisingly well and produced many state-of-the-art models
		- Detailed how SLERP, TIES, DARE, and passthrough work and provided examples of configurations.
