# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Read through more VLM articles to get a grasp on the lay of the land - added to [[2024-10-30-Wednesday]]
	- Spent a bunch of time trying to train YOLO on a custom dataset.
		- Got the dataset from [Roboflow Universe Search](https://universe.roboflow.com/search?q=notebooks+on+desk)
		- Also have utilities to do annotation in there - I just picked one from their repo
		- Augmented it and downloaded it - uploaded to Ultralytics hub to finetune a YOLO model
		- Tried to scrape images from Google initially which was turning out to be a pain - would then need to be annotated after
	- #j595/idea Would be cool to have a Bubbles tool that can call a DETR model and generate an image mask/box and then use motif to track that on device - talk to Humphrey about this [[meeting notes#Humphrey]]
	- Trained a YOLOv11-l on a custom dataset that I found on Roboflow and uploaded to Ultralytics Hubs
