# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- A bit overwhelming Sunday because I could not decide what I wanted to do and how I wanted to spend my time. Really wanted to go for Frisbee but also did not want to abandon Sana for the afternoon. Did not feel like going for Bikram. Ended up going for C3 with her and then went to REI + Trader Joes. Was a blah'ish day doing more of the same mindlessly wandering about. Got a bit of reading done (Prince of Persia journal) at Sanaa cafe in the evening #journal/meditations 
	- Dinner at OshiTaro ramen
