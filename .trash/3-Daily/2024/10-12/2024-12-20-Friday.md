	- [Finally, a Replacement for BERT: Introducing ModernBERT](https://huggingface.co/blog/modernbert)
		- The recent high-profile advances in LLMs have been in models like GPT, Llama, and Claude. These are decoder-only models, or generative models. What we’ve done, essentially, is port these advances back to an encoder-only model.
		- The output of an encoder-only model is a list of numerical values (an embedding vector). You might say that instead of answering with text, an encoder model literally encodes its “answer” into this compressed, numerical form. That vector is a compressed representation of the model's input, which is why encoder-only models are sometimes referred to as representational models.
		- #j595/idea - It might be worth finetuning a ModernBERT model for NotificationLM and even AttentionLLM. This would be the ultimate version that ships and run on device - might even run on the J310
		- ModernBERT’s context length of 8,192 tokens is over **16x** larger than most existing encoders. This is critical, for instance, in RAG pipelines, where a small context often makes chunks too small for semantic understanding.
		- For code retrieval, ModernBERT is unique. There’s nothing to really compare it to, since there’s never been an encoder model like this trained on a large amount of code data before.
		- *Adds RoPE embeddings instead of the vanilla ones from OG Transformers*
		- One of ModernBERT’s most impactful features is **Alternating** **Attention**, rather than full global attention. In technical terms, this means that our attention mechanism only attends to the full input every 3 layers (**global attention**), while all other layers use a sliding window where every token only attends to the 128 tokens nearest to itself (**local attention)**.

- #journal/daily 
	- Took a nap after breakfast and then test drove the Kia with Sana's family
	- Pune Police Station for Sana's background check. The lady was a total bitch and tripping on power. Did not do the job..
	- had the JP Shroff event at the grand Sheraton in Pune that Huzefa's friend invited us for. Went because Narayana Murthy was the chief guest. The event was packed AF. The room was really hot and Narayan Murthy is a BS speaker. Towards the end we got pulled in for some front row seating where I sat next toJamshyd Godrej. The entire event was very gimmicky - it was a family affair like a wedding mixed in with a foundation award ceremony mixed in with a product launch.
	- went to Kaka for dinner at 9 PM. Stay till midnight.
