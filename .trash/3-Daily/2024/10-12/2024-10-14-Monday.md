	- Liquid Foundation Models are a new architecture that seem to demonstrate the same scaling law as Transformers and State Space Models - not open source weights yet but is being created by Liquid AI

	- Got some cappuccino & croissants for breakfast and then went shopping for stuff from Carrefour. It was a bit of a walk but we had time before Foro Romano opened at 9am. Picked up a some pistachio cream, coffee & chocolates. Decided to drop stuff at the hotel and head straight to the Roman Forum instead of showering first. This was a great decision (again extremely lucky) because we reached before the crowds got in and were able to really indulge into the history of the place with Rick Stevens audio tour. What an impressive & magnificent ancient city. Quickly checked out the view from Palatine Hill.
	- Rushed back toward the hotel and found some more pistachio cream to pick up. Also got a hand bag for 40 euros. Quickly showered, packed up to rush to the airport. Decided to Uber instead of taking the train because it was not much more expensive and would save us a whole bunch of time without the worry of missing our flight.
	- Got to the airport in good time - chilled at the lounge for some time before boarding our flight back to SFO.
	- What a wonderful week and a half long trip! Disconnected from the world and day to day tedium to really indulge in activities I would otherwise plan on forever!
	- Cleared through a ton of emails on the flight. Wrapped up journaling for the entire trip while watching Roman Holiday & GodFather
