# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Productive chat with Humphrey on use cases for Scene understanding. 
		- Is Reza just using the [Yolo-world](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo-world/#faq) with custom classes for visual triggers?
		- Is the generic object detector a yolo-world model from VideoEng?
		- Can we make a Bubbles tool that invokes a generic object detection and creates a mask -> track with motif on device for a few secs?
		- Can we spawn off a track in motif based on a mask (ie pure optical flow)?
	- Chatted with Daniel Tang to do the Enroll app
