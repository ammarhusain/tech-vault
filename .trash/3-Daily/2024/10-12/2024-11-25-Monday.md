# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Slow lazy morning - chilled with some coffee at R Inn common area while Sana took her meetings
	- Called a few wineries to get a tasting booked - spots were surprisingly full
	- Got brunch at a diner in Napa - white egg scramble - I had a weird after taste from it for a while
	- Got dressed and head over to ZD winery for a tasting at 3.30pm. I chatted with Lindsey Harris of SBDC for an initial intake consult
	- Winery was really nice & cozy - it was a cold rainy day so felt nice to sit in the warmth sipping wine in the evening and just chilling
	- Dinner at Don something - popular italian place in Napa
	- Binged Love is Blind Habibi again and stepped out around 10pm to get some Gatorade from Walmart
