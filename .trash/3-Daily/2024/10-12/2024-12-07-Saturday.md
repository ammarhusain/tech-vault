# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Hosted brunch at CP club for everybody who came in
	- drove to Kanha around 11 AM giving a ride to her aunt and uncle
		- discussed a lot about nutrition, diet, and diabetes
	- roads to Kanha sucked took 5 1/2 hours to get there. Had a late lunch and unwind it for a little bit.
	-  I walked onto the road for a little bit in the dark. Everyone got in cars and drove through the village, just for fun to see if they can spot anything.
