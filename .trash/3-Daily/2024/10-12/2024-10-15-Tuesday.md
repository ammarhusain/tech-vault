# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595 
	- Learned about Bubbles - OpenAI RealTime API that we now have access to for prototyping
	- Created [[code-junkyard/llm-api.ipynb]] for Openai API
	- Played around with setting the openai real time api locally on my machine : They provide a [React app for inspecting, building and debugging with the Realtime API](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-console)
	```
	npm i
	npm start
	npm run relay
