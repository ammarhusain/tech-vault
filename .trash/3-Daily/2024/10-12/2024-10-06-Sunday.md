# TOP-OF-MIND
- #travel/italy #journal/daily  
	- Morning yoga with Amber. Nice big breakfast after. Excursion to the beach nearby on bikes but Sana’s bike had a flat tire so decided to drive. Scooped up 4 others in the car as we were leaving- Divya, Craig, Emma, Samina. On the way Faith had a flat tire so I dropped everyone to the beach and drove back to help. Picked up Lisa - Brittany’s mom while Sonya put the bikes in her car and gave a ride to Faith. Went the beach which was very meh - water not that great and barely any sandy areas.
	- Head back to Salinara around 1 for lunch. Took a nice afternoon nap before heading for Pilates. 
	- Yin deep flow with Hannah was right after so we chilled in the dining area for sometime. Great deep stretch session. Walked over to sunset point even though her class ran quite a bit over. Showered then dinner after where we spoke & chilled with Kim & Ana a bunch - passed out.
