# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Created a streamlit app that records a 5s video (can display it) , runs it through the XL-CLIP microsoft model and then calls a SmolLM-2 using llamacpp. Still need to flesh out the prompt in the streamlit app for a notification reasoning engine
	- Separate notebook to experiment with LLM prompting for notification decision process - SmolLM-2 has a small context window and does not seem to work very well. Need to try out MS-Phi-3.5 mini instruct or the [Chocolatine-3B-Instruct-DPO-Revised](https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-llm-leaderboard/jpacifico__Chocolatine-3B-Instruct-DPO-Revised-details) which is further trained on additional french data that seems to improve overall performance
