# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Tried out the Yolo-world model that is an open set detector [YOLO-World (Real-Time Open-Vocabulary Object Detection) - Ultralytics YOLO Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo-world/#faq) - also the architecture the VideoEng team uses
		- ~2 secs to set model vocabulary and 0.15 secs for prediction (27.2MB - yolo8s-world)
		- Model allows setting the custom vocabulary once and reusing it constantly for faster predictions
	- RT-DETR
		- rt-detr-l (66.5MB) -> 0.7 secs - model not promptable though
	- FastSAM
		- ~2.2 secs for generating object mask with FastSAM-s (23.9MB)
