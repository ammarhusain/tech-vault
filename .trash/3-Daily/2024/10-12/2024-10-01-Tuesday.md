# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Moved WorldStateCollator code back into AttentionKit as a hack to unblock myself; lots of ongoing issues with AgentMemoryD in that it keeps crashing
	- Audio quality with old englishroot just sucks - tried it with Leo and the transcriptions seem horrible
	- Still having issues getting the ASR model downloaded & working on Lotus #41 - Jordan has not been very helpful - just throws random excuses - talk to Dave Krimsley instead
	- The behavior from within AttentionTestApp seems funky as well - it keeps tracking people even though no tracks should have been there.
	- Drove home early with Victor
	- Continued working on [[karpathy#[Let's reproduce GPT-2 (124M) - YouTube](https //www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8pRSuU81PU)]]
		- Turi CUDA version has regressed - cannot run basic pytorch anymore so unable to run on GPUs and follow along all the optimization karpathy goes through
