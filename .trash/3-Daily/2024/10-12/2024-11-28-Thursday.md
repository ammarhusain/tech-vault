# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Woke up to go for a workout but somehow talked myself out of it - at the time I thought my body needed rest & sleep. In retrospect I should have just gone given how energized & motivated it makes me feel after - even if it sucks in the moment most of the time I am able to bare through it - its definitely making me stronger so I should just go when I have the chance #journal/meditations 
	- Slept in and had a slowish morning. Rushed to get ready, pick up the fish and head over for Thanksgiving at Taher-Shireen mamus place #social 
	- It was a fun relaxing day, hanging out and chatting with them. 
	- I slipped while walking back to take a picture which was embarassng
