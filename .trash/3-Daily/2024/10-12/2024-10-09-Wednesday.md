# TOP-OF-MIND
- #travel/italy #journal/daily 
	- Gave my laundry to Shaam first thing in the morning.
	- Yoga at 8am with Brittany - uncomfortable eye contact yoga
	- We all head for the Marsala docks to catch the boat to Favignana. We reached pretty late to the docks because Sana had forgotten something and missed the shortcut Yumi said she will lead us through.
	- Adriano was driving our boat that they had just rented to take us all.
	- Our first stop was a beautiful bay known as the Red Bay because there was a brutal war that was fought there during the Roman era. The cliff edges were also very cut up because the Romans used to use the stones for constructing structures on Sicily. Had a nice swim in the bay - water was chilly but not bad
	- We then left for the main dock on Favignana and got off the boat. There was massive choppiness on our boat where bags & people were flying around for a good 30 seconds. The group went to one of the restaurants but we decided to just walk around and explore. 
	- We both bought a linen shirt each from Nazaruls shop - he said he is one of the 4 Bangladeshi families there on that tiny island in addition to one from Mauritius. Everyone else was Italian (or some other European). 
	- Picked up an Arancini (fried rice ball with a vegetable stuffing) from a sandwich shop which took forever. I also had to pee really badly so kept looking for a restroom. Enjoyed it while walking around but we figured we should get some nice seafood as well when we bumped into Max-Jacky, Amber & Natalie eating a tuna steak. Ordered some fried seafood while rushing to finish it as we thought the boat would depart back at 3pm. We rushed back after picking up gelato & a magnet but turned out everyone was just chilling on the beach and in no rush to go. I jumped in the water again for a nice swim while Sana was bonding with Amber. Chilled on the beach for a bit - Sana wanted some earrings that she saw so walked back into town while I got a beer at the beach bar.
	- Boatride back to Marsala and then drove to Salinara.
	- Deep flow yoga session with Hannah
	- Had a long chat with Nate during and after dinner about AI and its implications - he was a chief of staff at a tech startup before quitting to travel around for a while.
