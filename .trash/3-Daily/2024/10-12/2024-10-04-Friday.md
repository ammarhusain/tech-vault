# TOP-OF-MIND
- #travel/italy #journal/daily 
	- Passed out for most of the flight since it was night time SF - bad thing to do given jetlag
	- Landed in Barcelona at 4pm. Immigration line was fairly long- took about 45 minutes. Has a massive argument right at the end of it leading up to the immigration counter.
	- Picked up our bag and took an uber taxi to the hotel. Should have taken the metro which was pretty convenient but for some reason Google maps time estimates for it were incorrect. Worth checking if the walk times are really as long. Showered and I checked out a plaza near the Hampton hotel while Sana got ready. Head into Barceloneta area via metro followed by bus transfer at Plaza Espanya. Walked along the marina and ended up getting tapas and wine at Parekete bar. Then walked over to get Paella at a popular local place that ChatGPT recommended. The wait staff were mostly Pakistanis. Took an uber back with a Pakistani driver Amir
