# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Super exhausted. I had a late start in the morning. Got some breakfast. Everyone packed up and we head out back to Nagpur.
	- long ass drive again, but stopped by a restaurant across from pench for lunch
	- reached home and Mom did her formality think of forcing everyone to have Chai and stay while her aunt and uncle had to go to the airport. Shuffled them out and drop them in heavy traffic. In retrospect should have just waited for Nilesh would've saved me an hour and a half of headache.
	- Sana was packing up to go to Pune when we learn that Alifiya's granddad had just passed away she canceled her plan and we all went to Lamiya aunty's place
