# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Added a lot more synthet ic data sentences for objects: pruned it down to just 3 objects - Homework, Audience & Ingredient
	- Created 3 new finetuning runs with 60k examples: (1) not sampling object sentences, (2) added ASR noise function, (3) isReferencedObject label
	- Read through Sri's memories docs
	- Refactored all the generate_* functions into a utils file for synthetic datagen so that they can be reused with the evals notebook as well. code has become much cleaner & organized now
