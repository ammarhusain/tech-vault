		- [A Survey of Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20011)
		- [Memory in Agent Systems - by Aurimas Griciūnas](https://www.newsletter.swirlai.com/p/memory-in-agent-systems)
			- Long term memory is divided into three distinct types. Procedural memory stores the production system itself: the set of rules that can be applied to working memory to determine the agent’s behavior. Semantic memory stores facts about the world, while episodic memory stores sequences of the agent’s past behaviors 
		- [Generative Agent Simulations of 1,000 People](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10109)
			- We present a novel agent architecture that simulates the attitudes and behaviors of 1,052 real individuals—applying large language models to qualitative interviews about their lives, then measuring how well these agents replicate the attitudes and behaviors of the individuals that they represent. The generative agents replicate participants' responses on the General Social Survey 85% as accurately as participants replicate their own answers two weeks later
			- How might, for instance, a diverse set of individuals respond to new public health policies and messages, react to product launches, or respond to major shocks? When simulated individuals are combined into collectives, these simulations could help pilot interventions, develop complex theories capturing nuanced causal and contextual interactions, and expand our understanding of structures like institutions and networks across domains such as economics, sociology, organizations, and political science.
			- When an agent is queried, the entire interview transcript is injected into the model prompt, instructing the model to imitate the person based on their interview data. For experiments requiring multiple decision-making steps, agents were given memory of previous stimuli and their responses to those stimuli through short text descriptions. The resulting agents can respond to any textual stimulus, including forced-choice prompts, surveys, and multi-stage interactional settings.
