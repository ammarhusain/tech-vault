# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Really unproductive day - one of the worst it gets even though it started off well with a nice morning workout. I should not have driven into Cupertino - rather stayed in and chugged along
	- Sold the window cleaning robot
- #j595/journal 
	- Experimented with creating and hosting pip packages
	- Dave got the VocalizationClient working for AttentionLLM - we can also use OpenAI whisper for transcription when Bubbles feature flag is on (much snappier performance) vs Apple ASR when off
