# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal #j595/memories
	- Productive chat with Sri on splitting up memories work - basically I ll mu ck around with the OpenAI realtime console & API to get the conversational agent load up some memory store and do generations based on that. I can hook it up with his evals system via simple text based function calls to GPT4o using the realtime API
		- ![[2024-10-17-Thursday-2024-10-17.jpeg]]
	- Lots of tinkering with the OAI realtime console and getting a grasp over the client API - there may have been a couple of bugs in it that I fixed. Got it to work in a way where it can store & retrieve a memory store

		- Next: Get it to automatically generate memories
