# TOP-OF-MIND
- #travel/italy #journal/daily 
	- Left for Hotel Tirreno in Trapani for scuba diving at 7.45am. Ana joined us for the dives. Took us 45 mins to get there and it was a very tiny dive shop with friendly owners. Went to donkey wall and a pavlovs ship wreck. 
	- Rest of the yoga group went to explore Marsala during the day
	- Lunch at A’Nassa in Trapani - had some very delicious grilled seafood - swordfish, prawns, squids
	- Reached back at Salinara around 4pm and took a brief nap followed by yoga at 5pm. There was a fairly long get to know each other session before he yoga started around 5.30pm. Discussions about going kitesurfing the next day over dinner that Denisha was organizing. Since all the guys were going I figured I ll sign up too.
