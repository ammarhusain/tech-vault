	- I could not sleep well through the night. It was a mix of jet lag and too much wine that my head kept spinning. Woke up around 4am and decided to head to the lobby around 5am. Stayed for an hour clearing through emails before heading back up and napping till 8.30. Thankfully was able to catch some sleep. Felt decently rested at breakfast - not the best but not bad either. Took a quick shower and took metro to the airport. Vueling bag drop was pretty quick and security moved through fast as well. Flight was delayed an hour so hung out in the lounge for a bit.
	- Picked up car and drove to Salinara with Craig Northrop. Reached just in time -5.20pm
	- Joined the evening yoga session. Dinner and wine with the group after
