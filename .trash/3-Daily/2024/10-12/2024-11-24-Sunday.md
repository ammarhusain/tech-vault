# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Slow lazy morning - packed up and drove out to Napa (R Inn) for a couple of nights - only took a little over an hour of driving from home
	- Checked in at the hotel around 11.30am and then got a fairly healthy Moroccan lunch at Oxbow public market. Took a brief nap back at the hotel
	- Checked out James Cole winery for a tasting - fun cute family owned winery with an antique car. Gustavo gave us a lot of good info
	- Got appetizers at the place Aashna highly recommended - their pizzas were to go only so e packed it and brought it back to the hotel.
	- Binged Love is Blind Habibi while enjoying the pizza for a night in
