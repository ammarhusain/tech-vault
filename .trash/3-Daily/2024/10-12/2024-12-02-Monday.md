# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Interviewed Gala Kaufman
	- Having a hard time getting back in the zone after the shutdown
- #journal/daily 
	- Did a quick final pack & clean up - left for the airport at 12.3pm. Qatar counter line was moderately long - took about 30 mins
	- Flight left a half hour late but no wifi on the plane. Really ruins all my work plans :(
