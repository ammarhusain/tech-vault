# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- dad's birthday today
	- went with Huzefa to PNB bank to open an account turns out I already had an account with â‚¹7000 that was dormant had to go to a different branch to reactivate it by submitting a new KYC
	- went to corridor seven again for a couple of hours while Huzefa went to take care of some work
	- lunch at CP club with him and Zafar
	- went to the office in the afternoon to hang out for a bit. Cut a cake for Dad.
	- came home to some temper tantrums from mom again. She really needs to get herself in order. He was pissed off about some sprouts that dad ordered. Had a massive fight with her where I put my foot down and said I do not want to deal with her BS. Lamiya auntie came over and we cut a cake for dad. Mom was still in a foul mood but distracted.
	- left for Pune at midnight
