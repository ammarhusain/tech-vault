# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Ethical Hacking book - [[tinkering]] - tried to setup VirtualBox which I got working but the PFSense VM crashes
	- Tried using Phi-2 model
		- Here are the results of it compared with using dolphin 2.7 mixtral8-7B model
		- ./server -m models/dolphin-2.7-mixtral-8x7b/dolphin-2.7-mixtral-8x7b.Q5_K_M.gguf --host 0.0.0.0 -t 24 -c 0 --mlock: ![[2024-03-12-Tuesday-2024-03-12-dolphin2-7-mixtral-8-7b.png]]
		- ./server -m models/phi-2/phi-2.Q6_K.gguf --host 0.0.0.0 -t 24 -c 0 --mlock: ![[2024-03-12-Tuesday-2024-03-12-phi-2-Q6.png]]
		- For on device server calls
			- phi-2 -> 1-1.5 secs though the reason is not getting generated most of the time : ![[2024-03-12-Tuesday-2024-03-13.png]]
			-  dolphin-mixtral-8x7b: gets around 3.5-4s on average (performs better)![[2024-03-12-Tuesday-2024-03-13-1.png]]
