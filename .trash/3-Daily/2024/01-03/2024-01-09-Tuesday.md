# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Kept hammering toward getting the attention streamlit app to spit out legible entities
	- Started trying out dolphin-2.5 & 2.7, TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF models
	- Llama-cpp-python does not seem to work for mixtral models - was getting terrible results at terrible speeds. Xin suggested comparing with llama.cpp which turned out much better:

	- Getting promising results now - I was unnecessarily over indexing on getting "interactive" mode working which was useless. I can just reprompt the model multiple times and run it on my mac studio pretty quickly. llama-cpp-python was adding unnecessary complexity and overhead. Was able to get very simple code working for forking a subprocess and reading from stdout
	- Need to get in touch with Marisa & Jakub again to walk through this with them.
