# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Got the server code working from within the app - settings are a bit off so some results are non sensical; need to make sure params match up - on branch <u>attention-llm-server</u>
	- Switched back to PR branch: <u>attention-llm-mvp-pr</u>: results make sense but it seems like the cache is not getting created so responses are taking ~12 secs. Need to figure out why
		- Here are the params: "--temp","0.8","--top-p","0.95","--min-p","0.1","-c","16000","-m","/Users/local/j595/llama.cpp/models/dolphin-2.7-mixtral-8x7b/dolphin-2.7-mixtral-8x7b.Q5_K_M.gguf","--keep","-1","--threads","12","--repeat-penalty","1.2","--in-suffix","","--in-prefix","", "--prompt-cache-ro"
	- Xin suggests using a low temperature and low top p for it to be more creative in its generation.
