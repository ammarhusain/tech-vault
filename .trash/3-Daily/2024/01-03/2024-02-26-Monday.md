# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- NatVoc is not running and thats why my "speaking" and "facing" signals were off
	- Models to try from Xin:
		- [cognitivecomputations/TinyDolphin-2.8-1.1b · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/cognitivecomputations/TinyDolphin-2.8-1.1b)
		- [cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2\_6-phi-2 · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2_6-phi-2)
	- Getting the interactive chat back up would also be interesting for more responsiveness
	- Prune the system prompt to also be much smaller
