# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Interesting paper in figuring out uncertainties in plans: [Robots That Ask For Help: Uncertainty Alignment for Large Language Model Planners](https://robot-help.github.io/)
		- Could be used with [[attentionkit-fc]] - at least framing the attention problem as a multi choice QA.
	- [Large Language Models as General Pattern Machines](https://general-pattern-machines.github.io/)
		- Interesting approach of just using the next token prediction ability of LLMs with in context learning to have it do arbitrary tasks with sequence of numbers - more relevant for motion generation
	- [How to make LLMs go fast](https://vgel.me/posts/faster-inference/) - ok article, not very useful for my immediate work
	- Was getting started on making good progress with prompt tuning but got derailed because of sigmond crash - this caused no motif tracks to come through . I ended up updating my device as a result which was a big mistake because now i have to get both AttentionKit and Motif repos updated to build within the new xcode. Pain overall.
