# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Got my local LLM endpoint on personal mac studio working with on device inference - had to change port from 8000 to 1337
	- ripped out most of the conversation agent code and got server responses parsed. Still need to get it working seamlessly with multiple audio streams.
	- updated model to dolphin-2.7 Q5
	- created lllama.cpp grammar from this blog post to constraint output - [Practical Techniques to constraint LLM output in JSON format | by MinYang Chen | Medium](https://mychen76.medium.com/practical-techniques-to-constraint-llm-output-in-json-format-e3e72396c670)
	- Paul showed me how to build a simple root with Motif with this script: ![[make_motif_root.sh]]
		- Build MotifTool build target (red circle) with "Build for -> installating" then copy path and run the script.
			- path example: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Motif-csydtojxmigbumbrsutgqatdvdam/Build/Intermediates.noindex/InstallIntermediates/appletvos
