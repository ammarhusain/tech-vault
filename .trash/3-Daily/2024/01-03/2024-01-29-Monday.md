# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Skimmed through this [AppIntents in Crystal doc](https://quip-apple.com/oKfwAGwm8VaU) that Saari had sent sayings its a must read - pertains to function calling with LLMs in AppIntents.
	- Played around with setting up Everest + Sunscreen workflow for AttentionLLM
	- Did not get much done in terms of LLM work itself
	- Mostly mucked around trying to understand motif entities and how to parse them out
	- Trying to create a sandbox with Everest though the "isGazing" "isFacing" attributes are not super stable in it.
	- Sunscreen does not do live replay well. Need to capture mcap files and work with those instead
	- I should get back to prompt crafting tomorrow - parse out to create a super simple prompt quickly.
	- Remember to use the [[set_live.sh]] script when trying to get live Motif entities from on device perception
