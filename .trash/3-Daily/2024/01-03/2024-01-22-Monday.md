# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Trying to get audio transcripts from the device for an AttentionLLM:
		- From Jordan on his audio work:
			- Here is the root for the model [https://apple.box.com/s/2oo1rha7h90c61cmwouz2599jllh2lcm](https://apple.box.com/s/2oo1rha7h90c61cmwouz2599jllh2lcm)
			- Run `MotifTools audio -s` to run all the audio analyzers & send to the system SwitchBoard
	- Trying to get MegaMotif -> MotifPanels working with Sunscreen
		- Got a bunch of help from Paul in getting the panels to visualize audio signals and then getting the root + MotifTools working on device
	- Checked out and running stuff on a real lotus device for the first time - not too complex
		- Learning a bunch about apple sdks & versions
