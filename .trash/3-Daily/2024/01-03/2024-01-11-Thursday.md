# TOP-OF-MIND

	- Signing on my tvOS can be done locally (its like popping open all the locks) - this is allowed for dev fused devices. When I run the same llama app on my iphone however that is not allowed since its a production device. Thats why I was signing up with a dev profile and enable automatic signing. In order to deploy apps on any iphone I need to have signing & cert capabilities. Usually you get that by registering with apple. Enterprises can get their own user profile and distribute their apps by getting an enterprise account and install custom profiles that gives them the ability to sign their own apps through that.
	- Got the llama benchmarking ios, tvOS app working by uploading the file into a bundle instead of downloading the models via a url. For some reason there was a 1 byte offset when trying to download the model with the comet url.
