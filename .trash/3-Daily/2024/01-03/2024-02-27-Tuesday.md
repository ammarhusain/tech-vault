# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Ran `python convert.py ~/Desktop/TinyDolphin-2.8-1.1b` to convert a model downloaded from HF to llama.cpp gguf file
	- Pruned the prompt by a lot - removed a lot of fluff and irrelevant motif signals
	- Modified grammar to be more constraining - seems to help with speeding up inference
	- Added reason back for CoT in attention scoring; modified it to rank all entities

# NOTES CREATED IN THE LAST WEEK
``` dataview

AND file.ctime < date(substring(this.file.name,0,10)) 
AND file.folder != "Daily"
SORT file.mtime ASCENDING
```

# NOTES MODIFIED IN THE LAST WEEK
``` dataview
