	- Kept wracking my brain on getting interactive mode working with llama-cpp python. It was a fools errand. Synced with Xin and figured out that the python binding can cache state. Need to resupply system prompt however.
	- Got scaffolding streamlit code mostly working though the system does not work - [[attention-st-ui.py]]. May be need to try bigger models

# NOTES CREATED IN THE LAST WEEK
``` dataview

WHERE file.ctime >= date(substring(this.file.name,0,10)) - dur(1 week) 
AND file.ctime < date(substring(this.file.name,0,10)) 
AND file.folder != "Daily"
SORT file.mtime ASCENDING
```

# NOTES MODIFIED IN THE LAST WEEK
``` dataview
TABLE file.folder AS Folder, file.mtime AS Modified, file.ctime AS Created
WHERE file.mtime >= date(substring(this.file.name,0,10)) - dur(1 week)
