# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Sync with Reza on memory and whether it can be used to summarize motif entities -> not useful
	- AWS route no-go for Comet -> vendor onboarding instead
	- Presented [[*shiny-fm-llm#LLMLingua]] papers in lit review [[J595 Literature Review - LLMLingua.key]]
	- Ran Everest + 3 agents with Xin photographer model on device:
		- Simply deploy llama.swiftui app -> start Everest -> spawn a few agents -> load model & click Bench
