**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2024-03-14)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Got the Llama Cpp On device framework compiled and working with AttentionKit (lots of help from Sylvain & Pauley). Needed to define the bridged interfaces headers.
		- Link to [documentation](https://confluence.sd.apple.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=SWIFT&title=Accessing+Non-Modular+SPI) - MotifVisual was a great example of doing so
	- Unfortunately the phi-2 models might be too large to ruin on device
		- Q6_K runs out of memory while phi-2.Q4_K_M.gguf seems to crash the device
