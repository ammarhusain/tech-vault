**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2024-01-23)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
-  Got Sunscreen working with the device hooked up and streaming channels
	- Still wasnt able to get MotifPanels or Sunscreen built from scratch (running the appshack version)
- Can visualize audio transcripts - final (Jordans work) and Attention states in the ambient mode (Jakubs work)
	- Pieces more or less in place for me to build up the LLM attention on top of
- Paul recommended building a "tool" instead of an "app" - would be much easier that way
	- subscribe to MotifTrackerState and Jordans audio msg
	- ![[2024-01-23-Tuesday-2024-01-23.png|300]] ![[2024-01-23-Tuesday-2024-01-23-1.png|300]]
- SignalMonitoringKit (sigmon), MotifTools, AttentionTools are good examples. You can have a simple parseable command and then need to write a "run" function. 
- "switchboard" is like the ros core - any app/ tool needs to create & hold a switchboard to do anything with sigmon messages
- Leo pointed me to the Livability app inside Apple Internal to update macOS - works pretty well
