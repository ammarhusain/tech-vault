**[DayOne](dayone://open?date=2024-02-15)**

# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Got sigmon channel publishing from the AttentionLLMTool
	- From Paul to get stuff working with MotifTools:
		- Add the channel consumer in VisualDisplay and the UI code in VisualObservationOverlay
		- It will be tricky to get Motif building with AttentionKit - need the channel proto definition
		- [Jakubs CL](https://github.pie.apple.com/heavenly/Motif/pull/635/files) can be an example
		- Mark helped me link a framework version that is not in the SDK yet from within my other repo. Basically have a workspace with difference projects and then link to the workspace version of the framework rather than the sdk version.
			- To get a root to automatically run stuff in the background I could (not sure how needed this is either - could just spin up to terminals and run the commands)
				- Add it to an existing daemon (Humphreys idea - prolly easier)
				- Use a "generic extension" that sigmond supports - RollingRecorder or Network Server are examples of doing it (Marks idea - sounds tricky)
	- #j595/perf - Got CometML working with AppleConnect SSO (moved from UAT-> PROD)
		- Tested on Xins & Pauleys machines
		- They have some certificate issues so had to remove the certs from keychain
