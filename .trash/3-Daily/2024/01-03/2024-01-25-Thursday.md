# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily

- #j595/journal 
	- Chat with Martin:
		- what to do with Comet? 
			- They want to talk to Saari / leadership before extending trial?
			- Let trial expire and get back again after vendor onboarding is done
			- Abandon Comet, try pick up W&B?
		- getting a bit sick of Luke just bossing around (not sure if the feedback for him really worked)
			- he is just showing up to meetings and dropping ideas
			- does not want to do any ground work or "manager" tasks - get turi instances, work with comet (these are non coding tasks that a managet can easily handle)
			- sentences that start with "i really think we should be" or "i want us to ..." with him no taking no further action than blasting out the sentence
			- i helped him get setup with Cheng - he went to Saari about it and then asked me to go the turi route
