# TOP-OF-MIND
-  Tried to revert back changes from Comet SSO. Got the application SAML request working - [Slack](https://cometml.slack.com/archives/C065PSNJ78Q/p1705085408656719)
- Got some examples and minor prompt tuning for the attention LLM [[attentionkit-fc]]
	- Shared the streamlit live app link within the team: http://17.220.22.194:8501/
	- Updated [Quip](https://quip-apple.com/EDZCA5mUXmwL) doc for  Attention+LLM
- Leo sent these over as good resources for  [Machine Learning Ecosystem Overview](phantom://2729f23f), [ Machine Learning in SWE: An Overview](https://quip-apple.com/2BXlA7WxkIQy)
