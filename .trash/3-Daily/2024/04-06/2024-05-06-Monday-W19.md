# TOP-OF-MIND

	- Had to DFU the device - [these instructions](https://confluence.sd.apple.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=ApplicationTechnologies&title=How+to+DFU) worked
	- Got eval script working for a couple of different models - converting them to pandas dataframe
	- Extracted some LLM timing numbers using the eval script (sent to Xin as well for his opinion)
		- Llama-3-8B  
			- Prompt eval ~ 300-900 tokens/sec  
			- Prediction ~ 16.5-16.9 tokens /sec
		- Mixtral-8x7b  
			- Prompt eval ~ 200-310 tokens/sec  
			- Prediction ~ 31.6-32.4 tokens /sec
		- Per Xin: I don't expect llama-8b faster than mixtral, but I also didn't expect it can be some much slower - two models have the same number of layers so the latency should be roughly the same

	- Sylvain: YOLO labels are  available only on request so not published at fixed frequency. We ll need some process requested it at 1Hz. Will also need something to keep perception memories (or persist labels) either in EntityKit of ActiveContext
		There is no pixel based or templated based tracker - it was too CPU intensive to run. The tracker right now is simply running at 2Hz and redetecting all bounding boxes. It simply attaches the bounding box for the previous detection to the current one by simple pixel distance heuristics
	- Made my first submission to the SapphirePalazzo train - [Instructions](https://quip-apple.com/Dvc2AbCDGo3G)

	- Chatted with John Khalil at 7.20am after a 6am workout [[side-hustle ideas]] - AI Data marketplace
	- 2 walking 1:1s with Jakub discussing the FC3 mess
	- Hour long 1:1 with Luke trying to explain Internal Judgment to him
	- 2 Networking events: Clem Demangue HuggingFace + SF Tech happy hour in the evening

	- Long discussions on System Agent, Active Context, Attention etc with Chris , Vera & rest of the group 
	- Marufuku for lunch with Hans, Paul S & Martin
	- Tested new audio changes by Jordan with AttentionLLM

	- Model distillation from this [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1cnlmz2/planning_for_distillation_of_llama_3_70b_4x8b_25b/) post:
		- The objective of distillation / transfer learning (in conventional Machine Learning) is to train a smaller "student" network on the predictions of a larger "teacher" network. What this means is, instead of training on the one-hot vectors of the tokens in the dataset itself (or training on the output generations of a larger model which is _not_ what is happening), the training objective is modified so that the model learns to mimick **the full spread of possible next token outputs** as predicted by a larger teacher model.
		- We can do this by training the student model to minimize the KL Divergence (a metric of distance between two probability distributions) on the output teacher model's predictions, rather than training to minimize the cross-entropy on the dataset itself (since the "true distribution" is fundamentally unknowable).
	- Meta mock interview feedback:
		- think about more edge cases - do more verification proactively
		- explain your solution before coding - wont need to revise
		- ask more clarifying question
		- practice more recursive questions & time complexity - will usually be exponential: k^n
			- (k)(k)(k)....(k) -> |------ n -----|
		- 2 coding questions per interview - 20 mins / question
