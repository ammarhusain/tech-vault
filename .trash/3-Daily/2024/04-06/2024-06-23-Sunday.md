# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily #travel/brazil     
	- Got breakfast at Cafe Cardin but locked ourselves out as we exited. Contacted the Airbnb host to get someone to open the door for us. I walked back from the cafe to meet the lady
	- Went for a hike to Tijuca forest - really cool park & hike right in the middle of the city. We did the Valley historical trail that covered pretty much all the park highlights
	- Had trouble getting an Uber back so we hopped in a taxi - but the taxi meter kept rising like crazy so we hopped off near a favela close to some beach along the way and ubered back from there. I was in a rush to get back but it would have been cheaper & faster to just wait for an uber at the park itself.
	- Changed an head straight to Copacabana beach to hang out. Took a nice dip and then ordered a caipirinha and chicken. The fried chicken took forever and was super expensive (~100R$s). Got some corn as well since we were pretty hungry
	- Sana & I got into an argument while chilling on the beach so completely missed the free concert we were hoping to go to that evening.
	- Got cleaned up, showered and head to Bibi Suco for dinner - I really did not feel like eating out but we didnâ€™t have much of a choice.
	- Walked back and checked out the local flea market on the main boulevard. Found some interesting art works for the house but did not buy anything.
