# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily #travel/brazil 
	- Woke up and got Sana’s birthday brunch at Cafeina Barata Ribeiro - Got an omelette and an açaí bowl to share
	- Nagpur family called up while we were there spoke for a bit but network was shitty
	- ⁠Walked back - called family again and chatted for a bit
	- ⁠Showered, changed and headed over to Christ the redeemer - took an uber to Corcovado train station - took the train to the top - Statue was magnificent - the place was super crowded
	- ⁠Missed the first train and overpaid for a picture. Took the train back down.
	- ⁠Ubered to Mirante Dona Marta - enjoyed a pleasant sunset at the helipad with a very few nice people who took really good pictures of us
	- ⁠With difficulty - got an uber back to copacabana
	- ⁠Went to a beach shack for dinner. Initially sat in Espeto Carioca - but the service was too haphazard so went to Xodozin instead which was nice - could see the beach and the moon
	- ⁠Enjoyed bobo shrimp curry rice.
	- Walked back to the apt - watched rio movie for a bit with gelato - after an unsuccessful attempt for city of god
