# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- [[2024-04-22-Monday-W17|2024-04-22-Monday]]
		- Working to get the attention LLM evaluation python script running
	- [[2024-04-22-Monday-W17|2024-04-23-Tuesday]]
		- Got the eval script into a working state - added the system prompt & examples before evaluation. Results seem more sane now
		- Chaotic Attention weekly meeting and seem to contain unnecessary politics - left early as I was not really feeling it
	- [[2024-04-22-Monday-W17|2024-04-24-Wednesday]]
		- Spent the morning reading the Millionaire Weekend book. Getting inspired to take the plunge and do something of my own soon.
		- Bunch of research on Getty Images and their business model. My planned idea is to pretty much create an equivalent marketplace for AI or primarily language content.
		- Updated my device and Xcode - trying to get the ToT of AttentionKit installed on device. I need to use Copy To Device (Internal) in order to install [[j595 cheatsheet]] and the binary ends up /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks
	- [[2024-04-22-Monday-W17|2024-04-25-Thursday]]
		- Presented [[*shiny-fm-llm#[The Era of 1-bit LLMs All Large Language Models are in 1.58 Bits](https //arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17764.pdf)]] at the literature review.
		- Fixed a [bug](https://github.pie.apple.com/heavenly/AttentionKit/pull/56) that got introduced while implementing fusion policy where LLM was not getting personaNames
		- Setup Everest scenarios to test out [[attentionkit-fc]] fusion policy. Got MotifTools visualize working to visualize tracks and scores
	- [[2024-04-22-Monday-W17|2024-04-26-Friday]]
		- Pretty shitty FC3 agent meeting
