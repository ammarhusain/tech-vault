# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Attention weekly mainly focused on the WorldModelManager which is Manuels version of the MotifSynchronizer. Xin wants to use it to provide stage notes to the conversationalLLM (per Marisa's suggestion)
	- Working to create an automated flow of the turi-finetuning.py file so I can kick off jobs in a quick and easy way
		- Setup Conductor by following [docs here](https://pages.github.pie.apple.com/storage-orchestration/conductor/docs/access/)
		- Added some examples on how to work with boto3 and s3 python sdk in the synthetic-datagen-sandbox py notebook
- #journal/daily #travel/brazil 
	- Went to the beach by myself: spoke to Huzefa about getting in touch with some news publishers. Sana joined me on the beach a little later for a brief walk
	- Showered, got a quick lunch and head to Cultura for my 1pm with Jakub Hudak. It was a productive chat and felt good to set & clarify vision.
	- Very productive work day until 8pm
	- Walked over to the May restaurant to check it out though I was feeling a nice steak that day so we went to Cadeiro Parilla: a father-son run restaurant. The young son was our server and we had a wonderful dinner there. It started pouring as we were getting out. Felt quite happy that evening
