# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Finetuned a model overnight but it still had the json.dumps() calls in it in the isEngaged and isReferenced generators - I should really be more careful & dilligent when coding these things since they can be finicky.
		- [x] Need to update the DynamicGrammar in the streamlit UI now  [completion:: 2024-06-20]
		- Found a another bug where I was using the wrong sentences (isReferenced) in the isRejected generator - that was causing the model to be very funky

	- This is the llama.cpp repo version I have been operating with atm. Might need to update it at some point soon.
		- commit b8c1476e44cc1f3a1811613f65251cf779067636 (HEAD -> master, tag: b2768)
		- Date:   Mon Apr 29 14:40:14 2024 -0400
	- Added computation of evaluation metrics to the turi-finetuning.py code (Claude is awesome!)
		- Computing BLEU, ROUGE, Perplexity and METEOR [[metrics]] for now. Just need to add a hook function 'compute_metrics' and use the evaluate library.

- #journal/daily #travel/brazil 
	- Showered in the morning and walked over to the Copacabana fort and then to Ipanema - got some lunch at Nusa Bistro and Brunch
	- Walked back through the inner streets - watched a snatch and run in progress lol
	- Pidgeon pooped on my head as we were exploring a couple of coffee shops nearby which was very annoying
	- Got back to the airbnb, quick rinse and head over to Cherin Bao to work for a few hours through the evening 
	- Quick workout at home.
	- ⁠Went to Zona Sul to pickup some stuff - Didn’t realize it was getting quite late (Almost 10 and pretty hangry)
	- Dropped the bags at the apt and went to Stambul for some dinner - there was a football game going on with Rio’s team playing and people were going crazy everywhere
	- Got home - tried to set up the TV but couldn’t really - YouTube was working so watched a bit of the video before turning in
