# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- I need to develop some synthetic data that has casper-sentences and regular sentences. Just sample subsentences and create a dataset of entities with high, medium or low engagement.
	- HAcked together a streamlit app in finetuning-eval-ui.py: its to test the finetuned model performance by feeding in more custom entities & speech than just passing through the eval dataset.
	- It seems like inference over the [[hugging face]] model without the grammar has the model just regurgitate strings from its training dataset and does not stick with (or produce) new entity names that it has never seen before.

	- **Tldr: need to use grammar to keep model on track**
	- The reason generation does not seem to work but the model seems to be doing a pretty good job following the gazing rule atleast by feeding in a few examples and evaluating it that way.
	- [x] #j595/todo  evaluate the finetuned model based on gazing rule with arabic names  [completion:: 2024-06-11]
	- [ ] #j595/not-todo  simulate some data with objects from YOLO

	- Woke up to jarring sounds of construction right outside the nano house. Turns out they are still constructing the other nano houses around us. Got pretty pissed off at the noise and the fact that Wi-Fi ain’t working. Made some of the instant cappuccino and walked over to the main hostel to get a bit of work done. Told Mary about the issues and she said she can move us to a private in the main hostel. We decided we ll take a break and head over to the beach for a bit and maybe move over to the main hostel. Went to Mole beach which was gorgeous and ate at a restaurant right by the water which had superb food and decently priced. The fresh coconut water right on the beach felt amazing. Discussed our living situation a bit and decided to chuck the hostel and just pull forward our Airbnb reservation to move in tomorrow instead. Had a long walk in the beach and then head out to get some coffee at another spot with a gorgeous overlook of the water. Tried Brigadeiros which were the balls of mithai. Took an Uber back to the hostel and worked in the common area for several hours. It was a productive work session (surprisingly). I didn’t even feel it getting pretty dark after a while. Back at the nano house and walked nearby trying to find food. There wasn’t anything open that showed up on Google maps so I decided to shower and then we took an Uber over to Bonis bar to get some food. It was a decent place (not amazing) with live music. Server spoke English which made our lives much easier. Tried the Brazilian shepherds pie which was interesting. Walked to a market to pick up some water and then had to wait like 20 mins just to get an Uber back. Did the crossword in bed for a bit before passing out.
