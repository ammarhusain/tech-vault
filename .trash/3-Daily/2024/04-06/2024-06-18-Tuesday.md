# TOP-OF-MIND
- #j595/journal 
	- Setting up a docker image to run in turi rather than reinstalling pip packages everytime. Learned a ton about setting up and using docker from this [internal apple doc ](https://bolt.apple.com/docs/docker-images.html#docker-basics)which has been helpful:
		- Here are the Turi Bolt [base images](https://bolt.apple.com/images/7cr9dybfig) -  [docker doc](https://docs.aci.apple.com/artifactory/docker.html#pushing-docker-images)
	- Finally got a docker image working with all the dependencies and conda installed 
		- boto3 conductor s3 access does not quite work from within python however. there are additional steps needed to get that authentication.
		- i will just use aws s3 CLI instead because that seems to work and i can make my life easier by using the cli to interact with conductor rather than banging my head to get it working within python - which is useless
	- Finally got the full flow working where I can now go from a turi task launch all the way to find the trained artifact on S3
		- Its not in my bucket however and instead on the BOLT_TASK_OUTPUT_PATH bucket but I know how to read from it and work with it so its all good!
- #journal/daily #travel/brazil 
	- Went to the beach again - this time entirely by myself
	- Worked out after - made lunch using remaining noodles, chicken and nuggets
	- Went to Cafe cultura to work
	
	- Slightly less productive day today because of the WorldStateCollator meeting that Manuel setup and being in the middle of Jakub & Manuel clashing with each other.
	
	- Sana showed me her FigJam for Crawlspace so discussed that a bit
	- Looked into no code tools like Bubble
	- Walked home - stopped by Hiper to pick up water
	- Got some wine at home while we packed a bit and cleaned up
	- Took our wine bottle to Galeria which was a bad idea as they got confused and cleared out our glasses while we ordered food - luckily they realized it and gave the glasses back
	- Got some Sehat Nasi Goring which was quite good - Sana got her black rice poke bowl (not as nice)
