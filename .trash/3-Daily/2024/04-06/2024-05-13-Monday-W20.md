		- Barged into [[attentionkit-fc]] meeting that Hans setup and did not invite me. Blah chat on Behavior models without any details. Over lunch he did suggest that Internal Judgment could output a suggested action like Bow etc. He does not see the DialogLLM being able to output actions in a timely manner.

			- In big orgs it is imperative to start talking about what you are doing and building without even starting on it to establish ownership. It is not uncommon for people to just come after your stuff and take your lunch. Even for attention after having established multiple times what the attentionLLM does Luke shamelessly claimed he did not know what that is and is actively trying to take it over. Hans did not even come talk to me to see how I can support his usecase. Always be ready to FIGHT BACK if you care.

		- Attention weekly meeting in the morning followed by the System Agent architecture meeting. The architecture meeting derailed & regressed again - no progress was made.
		- Doing an analysis of prompt processing using the TinyLlama and TinyMistral24M model. Something seems off since the tokenization between the 2 models gets very different number of tokens even though the tokenizer is the same with ~32k tokens.
			- [x] #j595/todo add a tokenizer in the script to count the number of tokens each prompt produces. [completion:: 2024-05-19]

		- Found this in AI newsletter - might be worth trying at some point
			- [x] [Knowledge Distillation For Fine-Tuning A GPT-3.5 Judge (Pairwise) - LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/finetuning/llm_judge/pairwise/finetune_llm_judge/)   [completion:: 2024-12-12]
		- Neighbors in the morning getting random small stuff done - ordered from 7Diamonds, AI newsletter etc.
		- Bailed on the Meta interview this afternoon because the interviewer was this guy Ishan Khot who might have ties with family back home.
	- [[2024-05-13-Monday-W20|2024-05-16-Thursday]]
		- Found this on reddit - worth playing with
			- [Llama 3 implemented in pure NumPy Â· The Missing Papers](https://docs.likejazz.com/llama3.np/) #tinker_short
		- Got in pretty late this morning ~11. Chill lunch and mostly been setting up SetApp for CleanShot, Numi etc.
		- Seems like there might be a bug in the llama-cpp server in terms of how the prompt is being evaluated. With llama-cpp-python I am getting the right number of tokens for both the TinyMistral and TinyLlama model where as when hitting the server the TinyLlama prompt eval numbers are in the 1000s range while it should be closer to ~5000

		- Confirmed a bug in llama.cpp-server ... Turns out the tokenizer for TinyLlama model does not seem to do the right thing and perhaps thats why the outputs are non sensical.
