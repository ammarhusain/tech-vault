# TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Called CA EDD: Seems like fucking Quickbooks has not submitted my Q3 2023 payroll tax return and wage report to the state of California [[Umri LLC]]. Therefore the notice I received. Called them but it does not seem like its even available online.
- #j595/journal 
	- Finetuned a TinyLlama model with DataCollatorForCompletionOnlyLM - this model only had the loss computation on the "completion" portion rather than the entire "prompt+completion" pair. The DataCollator helped mask the tokens that came before the response_template "### Assistant"
		- Seems like there is some bug here - it is not generating the attention scores but some random garbage. Retrying it with some changes to the response_template tokens "### Assistant" -> "###"
	- Ran an experiment with to verify that the TinyLlamaFineTuned models fit within the 1s time budget that we have allocated. This model ran without any grammars (or other bells / whistles). Just the raw prompt. - this is good news and worthwhile to de-risk early on
		- Tried adding grammar to the the finetuned model generation and it seems to make the model crap out - perhaps its not a good idea to add overly restrictive grammar to the smaller models and let them freeflow their way. They seem to do pretty well in that regard and dont hallucinate much (we'll see!)
			- ====Abandoning the pursuit of grammar for now====
		- Timing results - could present these in the Algs work journal

	- Productive day today - was able to knock out a few things even after having started late - the morning model deployment meeting that andreas organized was a good mood booster - helped get over the feeling of being lost and doing not valuable work #j595/meditation
