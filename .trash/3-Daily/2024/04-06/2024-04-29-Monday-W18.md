		- Have been thinking about this over the weekend and it seems like the best thing for us to do in FC3 for AttentionLLM is to focus on distillation and on device inference. We do not need the model to do any chitchat which can be hard to control and might need larger models. 
			- Could have a model that just takes the last N seconds of audio and runs at a 1Hz frequency. It can take in all the engagement scores and other scene context and jam it through an on device LLM to produce an entity rank + action.
			- [x] #j595/todo Run evalation scripts on Phi-3, Llama-3 8 & 70B as well as TinyLlama to see results. [completed:: [[2024-05-08-Wednesday]]]
			- Experiencing a weird issue where I am getting different results when running Phi-3-4k-Q4 model on my laptop vs on M2. The results from M2 are garbage while the ones from my laptop are quite promising. I made sure the llama.cpp versions are the same but still. I wonder if something funky is happening to the string during transport.

		- Manuel opened up to me about his frustrations and the feeling of being left out - something I struggle with myself on this team so I am not alone. 
		- Had a confrontational meeting with Luke after lunch on how he is trying to undermine attention.
		- Luke was talking in the FC3 meeting about his ML/LLM plans where he shamelessly took credit for a bunch of the VQA & visual scene understanding work that I had done in FC1 and assigned credit to Reza. 
		- #j595/meditation I feel like I should be less collaborative with those guys and not waste my time trying to help them succeed. I like Xin however as I can learn a lot from him
			- Confronted Saari about this (as advised by Martin) and that guy is just weird. He said Luke gave me credit and he knows about it - does not even want to listen to concerns and lacks any empathy. I had to bring to his attention the internal judgment work I have been doing as well.

		- Had a long draggy discussion again trying to agree on architecture with Luke. Got attacking & personal a few times. I stayed neutral mostly just focussing on the inputs & outputs for my system. Several follow ups during the morning.
		- Attended Spring Event for AIML at AP in the afternoon.

		- This is what Hans wants to do with his Behavior Model is exactly the "action sequencing" that we were proposing for FC3 - argh Luke jumped in there
