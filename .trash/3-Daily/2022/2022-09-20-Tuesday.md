# Top-of-mind
- Productive chat with Max this morning:
	- Cared really deeply about Intervention Reporting. I feel like if I can get that knocked out it will be super high impact
	- Creating robotis benchmarks that are services focussed would be another key contribution to tackle next #goal_long_term
		- There have been discussions around this in the "Solving Robotics Together" workstream with Brain. Julian Ibarz & Kanishka are the main folks to chat with at Brain.
- Also chatted with Mrinal, Kj and Michael
	- Seems like self awareness and ask benchmarks would be the highest impact areas to tackle.
	- Creating an EDR system wide capability limitations doc would also be impactful (similar to what we have for navigation & mapping) #goal_long_term. Probably benchmarks is a bit more tractable
