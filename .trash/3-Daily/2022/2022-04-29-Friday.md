# Top-of-mind

# Openai Chatbot that I Finetuned on My Hangouts History
- Created a rolling prompt with the chatbot app where it keeps a rolling context buffer.
- Running locally with flask
- Had t increase max_tokens to get rid of the pruning that was happenning
- Wrote a python notebook that parses a hangouts history and creates a ‘prompt’, ‘completion’ json file in a python notebook ^gnhs6a
- Used openAI prep dataset tool
- Signed up for Weights and Bias account and synced it with OpenAI
