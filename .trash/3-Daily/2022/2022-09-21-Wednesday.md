# Top-of-mind
- Chat with Brain HitL:
	- Mostly interested in data collection
	- Looking to RoboticsUI (web based) as primary tool for data collection - formerly ReachUI
	- Prioritizing data collection
	- Shifting strategy away from VR controllers to RoboticsUI
	- Mostly doing local teleop and remote teleop is possible
	- Possible to do asynchronous teleop - where robots are doing everything autonomously and can call for help when needed.
	- Browser can connect to multiple robots
	- Need help from EDR:
		- Need to upgrade GPU to A2000 - need eng help there
		- Availability of robots is not very high - need someone on site to start it up. Make it easy to operate for the data collection operator.
		- Logs get filled up very quickly
		- Make the fleet stable & reliable
		- Need the robot to be mobile with the manipulation
