# Top-of-mind
- Chatted with Josh:
	- His pushback for humans-in-the-loop was mostly against the tactical guidance that LT keeps giving
	- Advise on the new expanded role as Product lead for capabilities & learning:
		- Don't dilute yourself too quickly by picking on too many projects and not moving the needle on any of them
		- Gain credibility by going deep before going broad.
