# Top-of-mind
- Super productive discussion with Michelle Jones. She is a UX designer at Google. Great person to stay connected with for Sana to get her foot in the door.
- Chat with Jeff Gray, Mike Dory and Corbin Cunningham was also very productive. We spoke about how to get Chainmaker (1) working from the robot and (2) embed real work knowledge into one of the nodes. Should host them one of the days for an app day at EDR. May be do one yourself first to get a sense of how to write robot apps first.
