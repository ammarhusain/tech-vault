Abhinav : [[career/management|Product Manager]] rotation

- I think no one is happy with the progress that has been made on autonomy and reasoning so far. Lot of room to grow there. New PM headcount opening up that I could target for if this rotation goes well.

# Tasks
```dataviewjs
const date = `${dv.current().file.name}`
const query1 = `(has start date) OR (has due date) OR (has scheduled date) OR (has done date)`
const query2 = `(done on ` + date + `) OR (due on ` + date + `) OR (scheduled on ` + date + `) OR (starts on ` + date + `)`
dv.paragraph('```tasks\n ' + query1 + '\n' + query2 + '\n```');
```
