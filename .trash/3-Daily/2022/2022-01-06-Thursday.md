## [[random tinkering#Arduino 3D Printing]]
- Accidentally busted the Z-zxis limit switch cable when assembling the printer. Fixed it by simply solder a wire and heat-shrinking around it.
- Printer working... trying out the 3D benchy test print from here: [3DBenchy/3DBenchy.3mf at master · CreativeTools/3DBenchy · GitHub](https://github.com/CreativeTools/3DBenchy/blob/master/Single-part/3DBenchy.3mf)

3axis accelerometer: measures gravitation acceleration, we can get the angle using trignometry
3-axis gyroscope.: measures rotation velocity, we can get the angle by integrating the velocity

## Meeting with Abhinav

Autonomy & reasoning - interventions
Figure out what are our long tail of interventions and how can we move them from local to remote.
Fulcrum between jasmine (platform, tools etc.), srikanth (capabilities) & abhinav.... Paula, Yunfei & Abhinav are leading this from a tech standpoint
