##### TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Packed up for Alaska in the afternoon, showered and closed up the house.
	- Bhai and all left in the afternoon for their flight at 245.
	- Left for the airport around 5 - we had to return the car bhai had rented. We had underestimated the time it would take and we got to the airport ledd than and hour before the flight and missed the checkin time.
	- Luckily there was a flight at 9PM so we got booked on that. It turned out well because we went to the lounge and got a couple hours of heads down time to get some work done.
	- We landed in Vancouver at midnight. Got to the airbnb which turned out to be the same building Zeba dalal used to stay in - across the VFS animation campus.
