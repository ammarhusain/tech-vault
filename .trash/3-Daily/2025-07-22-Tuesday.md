##### TOP-OF-MIND
- #journal/daily 
	- Exercise physiology appoint at AC wellness - body fat % came out 19.9% which the guy said is pretty good -> could target 17% as optimal
	- [[memories-fc]] - Chat with Sri to reason about Judge grounding and designing precision & recall judges:
		- ![[2025-07-22-Tuesday-2025-07-22.jpeg]]
		- Judge grounding on `expected_conversation` is essentially crap. The planner seems overly engineered and not really an oracle but more a BS'er
	- Fixed git lfs tracking a ton of files in the repo which probaly kept braking the git lfs hook in obsidian - hopefully thats all cleaned out and fixed now
