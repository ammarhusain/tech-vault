## [Learn music theory in half an hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgaTLrZGlk0&t=175s)
- There are only 12 notes: 
- Each note vibrates at a certain frequency - fast vibration is high pitch and slow vibration is low pitch
- White notes on piano are names A through G. Black keys are named relative to white keys with the words: flat (lower) & sharp (higher)
- our brains can tell when a vibration is twice as fast as another one - they are the same note
- distance to go 12 notes up or down to an identically named note is called an octave
- most songs will use just 7 notes - those are the major keys
- Example keys: A-major, C-major etc
- chords are multiple notes played simultaneously - set the emotion & story of the music
- major sounds happy, minor sounds sad
- rhythm & counting: typically 4 beats to a measure

## Drew Khalouf
- Engaging in conversation/ storytelling should be like social intercourse rather than social masturbation.  
- Liquefy 'u' : pronounced as "yu" ... new, stupid
- Rounding 'o': Not 'a' but an 'aw' ... of, obsessed
- Voice 'th': words like with, whether
- Make the 'z' sound for plurals that end with a voiced syllable: Remebers "Potsss & panzzz"
- Make sure to liquefy 'u', round 'o', voice 'th' & make 'z'  to sound more authoritative.
- When communicating with someone, talk as if they are your (i) beloved & (ii) rather dumb.
- "Checking In" is to pause every 2-3 sentences and wait for them to catch up to you. Its like you're taking them on a hike, so wait for them before the switchback as you lead them through.
- Operative words are spoken louder, slower & with a stressed inflection.

Stretch:
Alignment - spinal cord
Centering - your mind

Breath work:
Organic centered sound 
Expanded and enlarged sound 
Work on your channel - throat, nose, etc
Resonators - hard parts of your body that’s vibrating
Articulators - things that shake
