- Not entirely clear on what needs to be done for this Memory thing? I got pulled in with half context
- Also got pulled in with expressions (from Hans)
- I wanna create an AIML task force:
	- Yi - benchmark finetuning datasets
		- Two immediate usecases - expressions & behavior generation
	- Xin - generative canvas entity extraction
	- Reza - summarization for memory extraction
	- Me - VLM stuff
	- Josh & Andreas - on device integration, prompting
	- Who else to invite? Hans? - needs to be focused - Marios, Saari optional
- Scheduling W&B demo - should I ask Jason? or just do it myself?
- Need new Mac Studio - Saari not responsive

- Feel free to say no to stuff - push back on random requests
