# Principles
- Communicate quickly rather than slow & deliberately
- Be more generous - spend money for joy
- Assume the worst in people - stop reading textbook advise
- Be confrontational - stop being nice and agreeable
- Succeed at home first.
- Hustle while you wait.
- Make a positive impact in the lives of > 10 people.
- Take time off for short vacations.
- Optimize for the long run and take the long view on people & situations.
- Don't work for the results, work for the "why"
	 - why you do what you do → how you do those things → what you end up doing
	 - people don't buy "what you do" they buy "why you do it"
- Fill the uncompromising minute with 60 seconds worth of distance run
- Don't get greedy!
- Get ready for the day the night before
- Pay for convenience - save time over money
- Adopt a mastery mindset and NOT a success mindset
- Dopamine from information gathering is a dangerous drug. Get your dopamine from action.
- Stop treating rest as a reward and start treating it as a critical part of your high performance routine.
- Stop blaming others for your situation and start taking action to change it.
- The time you spend comparing yourself to others is much better spent investing in yourself. The only comparison worth making is to you from yesterday.
- You’re one year of focus away from your haters saying you got lucky.

# Develop
- Minimize your identity. "I am an X sort of person"
- One proficiency a year.
- Automate or delegate repetitive tasks.
- Listen to understand.
- Seek help and be proud of asking stupid questions.
- Strong eye contact
	 - Use the triangle technique (left eye, right eye, center of forehead) and every 5 secs rotate which vertex you are looking at
	 - Make eye contact before you start talking to someone
	 - Pause and hold for about 5 seconds; about as much time as it takes you to register the color of their eyes
	 - 50/70 rule: make direct eye contact 50% of the time when speaking and 70% while listening
	 - Look away slowly; looking away too quickly (darting your eyes) makes you appear nervous or shy
	 - Never look down, look up or to the side; break your gaze to make a gesture or to nod to avoid showing discomfort due to prolonged eye contact
- Maintain a very modest standard of living
	 - You're at Apple not for the compensation but to work & network with really smart people
- Good work habits; compounds over time
	 - Know what you need to do each day and have the discipline to do it
- Keep your ego in check to keep moving forward
- Confrontational & argument skill
	 - Relaxed posture & deep breathing
	 - Forget about being 100% accurate, be concise
- SMART goals: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Results focused, Time bound
- Paradoxical Intention: When suffering a phobia or anxiety, invite for a few moments to intend, precisely that which you fear.

# Let Go off
- FOMO feelings
- Feelings of being unwanted or uninvited or undesired
- Being a perfectionist
- Being stuck and procrastinating
- Trying to fix everything
- Over analyzing and incorporating external feedback
- Hiding your flaws or weaknesses and overcompensating
	 - Embrace it that you're a little weird and its ok
- Having expectations on how people perceive or respond to you
- Rationalizing and reasoning
	 - Just state your case and make your point
- Living a consensus life and trying to impress people. Impress yourself instead and be internally driven

# Questions to Ask Yourself
From Sahil Bloom's newsletter:
- If I repeated this day for 100 days, would my life be better or worse?
- If someone observed my actions for a week, what would they say my priorities are?
- If I were the main character in a movie of my life, what would the audience be screaming at me to do right now?
- What are the Boat Anchors in my life?
- Am I allowing more information to get in the way of more action?
- What lie have I repeated to myself so many times that it feels like the truth?
- If I knew I would die in 10 years, what would I do today?
