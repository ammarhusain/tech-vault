Sana's birthday today - made her coffee & grilled cheese breakfast.  
Dropped Sana to Glen Park BART for her Figma conference and then morning at Philz today. Met Nishanth for wearscape-ai advising. Learned about delegating projects to Upwork which was interesting.  
Lunch and then went over to Progressive in Bernal to finish reading The Story of Philosophy. It was a bit distracting initially thinking about home remodel stuff. Was a bit irritated since he still hasn't secured a city permit for the work. Picked up Sana from BART then Vora, Aashna & his mom came over to hang for a bit - that was nice of them Birthday dinner at Chouchou french bistro which was quite nice.

Neighbor cafe in the morning

Had a chill coffee in the morning with some emails. Head over to the ferry. Was just daydreaming through the ferry ride. It arrived 15 mins late into Roatan so that made it super tight to catch my 12.30 United flight. Luckily I didnt need to check in my bag so was able to make it right on time as the boarding was slowing down. Initial technical snag on the flight but it eventually took off 20ish mins late. Finished reading On Fear on my kindle.

Connecting flight transfer was chaos and slow with no pre-check at Houston airport. Head over to terminal C and then to the Centurion lounge. Was quite a trek but I was super hungry so was good to get the food there even though the line for the lounge was annoyingly long. Didn't spend too much time there and head straight for the SFO gate. Flight was a bit delayed again but not bad. Did a bunch of photos filtering from Japan & 2023 in general on the flight so that was productive - and also nice to revisit the memories.  
Sana picked me up from the airport and had a nice dinner at home

2023-06-17-Saturday

Last couple of dives this morning - Sophia & another german girld were leading. Was with Frank a German guy as my dive buddy  
It was great to be underwater and chill to be out on the boat  
Came back, logged dives and chilled for a bit

Went over to Utila chocolate factory - had some coffee there and bought some chocolate bars  
Went to this little shack near Marios that is also associated with a dive shop. Had a pescado enterro there which was

great and I was super hungry. Met this italian guy and this german girl while I was eating and one after the other. I didn't have enough cash to pay the lady for the food so tried to go and withdraw some but the ATMs weren't working. Gave them 150 limpiras with a 50 limpira balance.  
Came back to Underwater vision, chilled for a while in the water - went for a swim. Got out and went with some dollars. Gave the shack 5$ and then bought some M&Ms with 50$ at Bushs where I got limpira back. Packed up my bags a bit in the evening

Was doing a bit of reading & summarizing at Trudys. Saw Cate there - she was headed out for dinner. Was a bit awkward so I didnt join them. I was a bit anxious on what I should do this evening in terms of socializing. Ended up

getting a beer with Frank (German dive guy) and an Australian couple who were fun. Was also joined by this very cocky & annoying Chilean guy with his Aussie buddy. Overall a chill night. A bit of regret not to have gone to the Thai place with Gil, Sophia & the Swiss couple but turned out to be a good night.

2023-06-16-Friday

Came back to a iced espresso and fruit salad. Cleaned up and took a nap.

2023-06-14-Wednesday

Morning dives today- went to the northsude of the island so a long boat ride. Thankfully I popped a dramamime since I felt quite sick on Monday during the surface interval. Dramamime really helped and felt more in control.

Went over to Joe n the Juice on Montgomery after lunch (walked to Glen Park BART from home ~20ish mins). Continued StreamLit migration. Then went over to meet Ashish at 345 Spear. Took Muni to Verve after waiting for Sana to pick me up  
Queried ChatGPT for PointNet and ShapeMask

PointNet simply takes in an unordered set of vectors - so Nx3 for the xyz point coordinates. It is able to operate the neural network on top of those.  
Pointnet (vanilla) has 0.8 parameters while full net has 3.5M parameters - pretty doable on robot  
ShapeMask has anywhere from 0.02M to 1.44M parameters while Mask R-CNN has 2.64M so much fewer than that.

Productive chat with Jose G about contract. Seems like he is willing & ready to execute. Goal is to unblock him with parts & decisions asap.  
Went over to Pranays to hang out - farewell as he moves to NY; ate butter chicken and brought back his standing desk.

2023-05-23-Tuesday

2023-05-17-Wednesday

Went down to get coffee in the hotel lobby and check emails. Spoke to Kevin from Apple for a bit. Walked over to higashi hoganji temple near the hotel. There seemed to be a bit of construction going on so we didn’t really go in much. Walked back to hotel, got dressed and head over to catch the train to Nara. I left a bit early to find breakfast. Found a really really good bakery in Porta B1F floor. Their breads were delicious which we picked to carry with us on the train. Took the bus to Nara park once we reached. There were friendly and hungry deer everywhere. Fed a few packs of crackers to them before we head into Todaijee temple. The Buddha statue inside was huuuuge indeed. Walked around to one of the stupas on the right of the temple. Stopped to get some tea and juice at a small little cafe. Walked around to another little temple in there and then walked by out to get some soba right outside the temple. It turned out to be really good. We then walked to isuien garden which had closed by the time we arrived so we went to the neighboring yoshikien garden.garden was great but couldn’t find a tea house in there unfortunately. Walked out and head over to check out kofukuji temple also in Nara park. It was closed but also beautiful. There were school kids everywhere in Nara and we kept getting stuck in lines behind them. We fed several more packs of crackers to the deer and then took the bus back to the station. The rapid train was like 45 mins later so we got a pancake at Mos and coffee. Then picked up a bunch of snacks and Starbucks lattes at 7-11. 7-11 are popping in Japan. There was an Italian woman who didn’t shut up for the entire train ride, it seemed like her companions also were tired of her yammering away. Once we reached back to the hotel both of ended up in the bath for an hour. It was hard but we dragged ourselves out to dinner. We were searching for Yakiniku but ended up getting some Xiao Long baos at a place across the hotel. The chef was nice, gave us some stickers and waved long good byes as we left. Back to hotel and passed out.

2023-05-16-Tuesday

Woke up early and I went by myself to get coffee at some coffee shop in smart inn hotel. It was a bit overpriced and meh. Sana met me over there and then we walked over to a very nice shinshido boulangerie in sanjo kawaramachi to pick up some bread and croissants. Packed it and took it back to the hostel to eat in the lounge there. Packed up to check out of the hostel. Dropped our bags in the hostel lockers and took bus over to kyoto prefecture cultural center to watch the Aoi Matsuri procession. It was very long, orderly and super silent - amazing how disciplined a country Japan is. Walked over to the Taramachi market to shop around a bit. Sana picked up some clothes and I picked up some art/ souvenirs. Had a delicious lunch of some soup curry at a little restaurant in front Joshin-ji temple. Restaurant name in Japanese translated to Earthen pot soup curry (it’s on the corner building second floor). Walked through Nishiki market considering whether we want dessert. Turned right and walked for 4ish mins to the hostel to pick up our luggage. Took train over from kawaramachi to kyoto station. It took around 30 mins but was an adventure inside kyoto station trying to find the exit closest to the hotel. Walked over 10ish mins to hotel, checked in and chilled in the room for a bit. Contemplated whether it’s worth going to the shrine to watch the Aoi matsuri festival again but online reviews seemed to indicate it’s hard to see the. Ceremony and the festival overall is very subdued so not worth the hour long trek over. After it cooled down a bit walked over to kyoto station to head over to Arashiyama bamboo grove. Picked up matcha and coffee at Nana cafe before taking the train over. Arashiyama was beautiful- looked around trying to find a tea house with tatami ATS but didn’t see any out there. It was also late to be able to go to the monkey park. Walked around for a while. Then ended up doing a long ass loop because half way through the walk back to the station we started following the wrong signs. Finally reached Shaga Arashiyama station and took the train back to Kyoto. Picked up some weird jelly water froma vending machine. Were debating what to get for dinner since Sana wanted soba but my stomach was a bit off. Got some really nice chucked and rice soup at the station. Went back to androoms and I took a bath. Spoke to family before hitting the bed.

2023-05-15-Monday

Had breakfast at Inoda coffeehouse - very popular place with locals. Food and coffee were both great though expensive. Did laundry and then decided to head to Osaka since the Aoi festival got postponed. Took the train over to Osaka station and then had an adventure finding bel vie pancake station in the Osaka station basement. Pancakes were fluffy and amazing. Then went to a conveyor sushi place right across from it in Whitt Umeda central hall. Sushi was awesome too - over ate a bit. Head over to the Osaka museum of houses - it was great to experience how people in Heian times ~250 years ago used to live. Nice little coffee at a banana themed restaurant in the building where the museum was housed after that. Went to Dotonbori and walked around a lot! Sana did a bit of shopping while I just tagged along. Went to the hozenji eat street around there and sampled a bunch of food - yakitori, karage etc. finally ended up at a little izakaya where we sat on the counter and were served delicious Japanese tapas. Took train back to Kyoto and ended up back at hostel around 10.30pm

2023-05-14-Sunday

Started the day looking for coffee. Inoda coffee had a really long line of Japanese people for some reason. Ended up going to Paul- a French Japanese bakery for croissant and coffee. Showered and head out for the kawaramachi subway to go to the main station. Took the bullet train from Kyoto to Osaka. Went over to umedA sky building in Osaka. Fun tower where we took a bunch of photo shoots of each other. Then went down to the basement where they created an eat street like vibe. Got some nice udon noodles there. Time was running tight so we deliberated whether to go to Osaka castle or head over to Dotonbori district instead. Figured might as well get Osaka castle done so we head there by subway from Osaka station. found a nice pan cake cafe on the way in. Should have just stopped to eat then but we were running short on time since castle closed at 5. Castle itself was nothing too great though some of the exhibit videos on floor 7 were fun. We head back to Osaka station and then it was an adventure trying to find fluffy Japanese pancakes, was in successful.

Took train back to Kyoto, dropped stuff off at the hostel and head to hanatanuki kawaramachi for some yakisoba and okonomiyaki, both delicious. Another unsuccessful attempt at getting crepes or dessert but the day overall was packed & fun.

2023-05-13-Saturday

Checked out of the ryokan. Could have slept better the night before. What an amazing experience. The hostess and check out staff waited at the door until we were out of sight and kept waving and bowing at us.

Checked into Piece hostel. Nothing would match up to the Ryokan experience. Walked to Yasaka Jinja shrine, got ramen then continued walking to Kiyomizu Dera temple. It was an incredible monastery and I can only imagine living there as a monk in the peace and quiet.

It started outing heavily so we stopped at a local cafe for matcha and red bean rice dessert. Took a cab back and stroller through Nishiki market. Street food there was so so good.

2023-05-12-Friday

Checked out of Tokyo hotel and took the Shinkansen to Kyoto. Was feeling a bit under the weather after the Fuji trip. Should have really bought the inhaler. Dropped luggage at the ryokan and went to a nice cafe nearby. It was a cute theme & vibe. Had two ice cream floats there. Then took the bus over to Kinkakuji temple. It was hot and very crowded. My best time there was at the tea shop. Went back to ryokan and were served delicious hot tea and matcha again. Then went in for a bath at 6 before dinner. Dinner was a really really tasty kaiseki cuisine meal. Posted some stories to Instagram and went to bed.

2023-05-11-Thursday

Woken up at around ~4am by an alarm on our phones of an impending earthquake. Felt the shaking around 30 seconds after for about 30ish secs. It was cool to experience an earthquake in Japan. Apparently the magnitude around our location 3 ish while the epicenter was 5.

Day trip to Mt Fuji. Took a train to Otsuki to transfer to a train to Kawaguchigo. Took the later train at Otsuki station to eat some soba which was really good. Once we reached kawaguchiko walked over to a coffee place round the corner and continued towards the cable car. Got very lucky in that we didn’t have to wait to get in and up to the viewing deck. Nice partial views of Fuji. Had some packed up pastries with the view. Came back down and took bus to nature center. Then head over to a nice museum by a textile dying artist, with an exhibit of beautiful silk dyed kimonos. Had to wait Way too long to get bus back to kawaguchiko station. Ended up missing the Fuji express station so took a local to otsuki and then connected there for Shinjuku. Was a very tiring journey back from Fuji to Tokyo. Wonder if it would be better driving next time. Also Fuji area is nice to stay and spend a few days.

Had a Yakiniku dinner with a premium wagyu beef sampler. Followed by sake on a tatami mat in golden gai.

2023-05-10-Wednesday

Checked out Shinjuku and Shibuya neighborhood.

Had a heavy traditional Japanese breakfast at the resting across the hotel. Walked to government office building observatory. Tried a standing sushi bar for the first time, amazing sushi! Went into a beautiful tea house in the shinjuku park where I tried a matcha red bean paste mochi for the first time. Came back to rest up in the hotel for a bit before heading to Shibuya. Checked out the famous Meiji shrine then walked from that neighborhood to Shibuya crossing. Was trying to get into this sushi no Midori at Shibuya station but it was packed. Ended up getting very ok yakitori at a neighborhood restaurant. In the way back tried our luck at the sushi place and were able to get in. The sushi unfortunately wasn’t as good as we expected it to be. Headed back to Shinjuku and ended up in an unsuccessful attempt to find toasteees. Finally settled for some cake at Smokist coffee house next to hotel.

—-  
From Sana:  
Had coffee across the intersection at Smokist Coffee with sweet butter bun and soft white chocolate croissant.

2023-05-08-Monday

Took off from San Jose at 12:10pm. Travelled zipair for the first time. Unfortunately the
airline did not have TSA Pre so had to go through the security like commoners. But the flight
was a pleasant surprise.. even though there were no free meals served, we could pre-order a
cheap meal which was quite tasty. We had ordered Chicken Teriyaki and Salmon Koji. The flight
also had a system where you could use your phone to order snacks and drinks to your seat,
again very cheap and very convenient to use since we didn’t have carts going up and down the
aisle. No in-flight entertainment either but they had a few movies available via WiFi. We
landed at Narita at 3pm on [[2023-05-09-Tuesday]] and had to stand in a really long line to
get a JR pass, but it was worth it as it allowed us to travel almost everywhere in Japan and
saved us a lot of money. We took the Narita express to Tokyo station and by this time we were
jet lagged and starving. We ate some chicken ramen at a restaurant in Ramen Street at the
Tokyo station and took a cab to our hotel in Shinjuku. The cab driver took a wrong turn which
took us 3 min longer to get to our hotel, but at the end of the trip paid us back 300 yen for
the inconvenience. This was the first experience of the honesty of people in Japan.
