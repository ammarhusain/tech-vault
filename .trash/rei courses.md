First step in developing survival skills is to focus on prevention. Think through an emergency plan before departure.

Always pack with Ten Essentials in mind.

When faces with an emergency: Stop, Think, Observe, Plan

Breathe: Overcome fear/panic, take stock, slow down and increase awareness

Survival Priorities: Rule of 3’s

- 3 minutes : for breath
- 3 hours : for exposure
- 3 days : for dehydration
- 3 weeks : for starvation
- 3 months : for social contact

When faces with an emergency likely first priority : Shelter

- Cozy waiting place, not a hiding place, be seen
- Shelter should take into account:
	 - 5 ways we lose body heat: Evaporation, Convection, Conduction, Radiation, Respiration
	 - 5 W’s of location: weather, water, widow makers, wanimals - wigglies+wildlife
	 - Photos

	 - Get Found: Be sure shelter location is visible. Use bright materials. Use signal mirrors and whistles to attract attention

7 principles of the outdoors:

- Stay on trails
- Leave nothing behind
- Leave what you find
- Respect wild animals
- Scooop your poop : 6 inches deep cat hole and 30 paces from water
- Pack your trash
- Minimize campfire impact
- Respect other visitors

Practiced in class: Slip knots and one more?

# REI Backcountry Navigation Course

[[2022-04-9-Saturday]]

Map Bearing → To localize

Field Bearing → To navigate

Need to get map bearing first in order to start hiking towards goal.

First step to get map bearing is to shoot field bearings (aka localize) to different landmarks and triangulate

CalTopo or MyTopo to download topological maps

Index contour lines (bold red) are every 1000 feet

UTM used in search & rescue

1 degree off is 100ft/mile

Types of landmarks:

- Handrails - things to have on the left &/or right
- Backstops - If you see or reach this you’ve gone too far

Make sure to set the appropriate declination on the compass
