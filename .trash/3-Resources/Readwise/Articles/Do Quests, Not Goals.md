## Highlights
- **A quest is an adventure, and you expect it to be one.** You expect a quest to take you into a new and unfamiliar landscape. ... The goal mentality frames this stuff as setbacks, problems, pains – stuff in the way of the goal.
- **A quest changes you, not just your situation.** Goals are practical attempts to change your circumstances. A quest is personally transformative – the endeavor itself shapes who you are, and what you’re capable of. It’s not only the reward that does this, it’s your inevitable encounters with the unfamiliar, and the new capabilities you gain as you handle these encounters.

- **A quest has a dragon to slay (and it’s inside you).** In all worthy quests, you (the hero) at some point will face a fearsome beast that seems at first like it will be your doom. Maybe there’s a tough conversation you have to have, or a tricky concept you have to learn. From a distance, the dragon always seems unconquerable, yet the hero finds a way. In epic fantasy tales, the dragon is always symbolic — the hero defeats it by overcoming some inner sense of limitation, which they had believed was a permanent flaw.
