## Highlights
- Write down what you want your obituary to say, then figure out how to live up to it.
  Everyone’s will be different, but I suspect most people would want their obituary to say: You were respected. You were admired. You were helpful. You were a good parent, and good spouse, a caring friend. You were an asset to your community. You made a contribution to your industry. You were wise, funny, and smart.
  Now realize what’s not in there.
  Virtually no one in this exercise would think about their obituary mentioning how much horsepower their car has, how many square feet their home is, or how much they spent on jewelry and clothes.
  I like nice things. I have some fancy things. But I’m always struck by the contrast here of what people want vs. what they aspire to. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbxt12dt5mmr8zmjhtj3pq5a))
- You might think you want an expensive car, a fancy watch, and a huge house. But I’m telling you, you don’t.

- If you can get to a point in your career where your name becomes bigger than anything you can purchase, there’s your value.
  There is nothing I can buy that is bigger than my name alone. So it made no sense [to buy jewelry]. *I’m me*. It’s pointless. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbxsxds3anevat53rqfhydy5))
