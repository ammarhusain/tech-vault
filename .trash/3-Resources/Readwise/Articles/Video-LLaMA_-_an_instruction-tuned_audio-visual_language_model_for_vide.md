## Highlights
- Video-LLaMA bootstraps cross-modal training from the
  frozen pre-trained visual & audio encoders and the frozen LLMs. Unlike previous
  vision-LLMs that focus on static image comprehensions such as MiniGPT-4 (Zhu
  et al., 2023) and LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023), Video-LLaMA mainly tackles two
  challenges in video understanding: (1) capturing the temporal changes in visual
  scenes, (2) integrating audio-visual signals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6ppkjg8dbwh4c5jbw2jqrtm))
- we
  propose a Video Q-former to assemble the pre-trained image encoder into our
  video encoder and introduce a video-to-text generation task to learn video-language
  correspondence ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6ppmf6tsfvgmcwqqqkqympw))
- we leverage ImageBind (Girdhar et al.,
  2023), a universal embedding model aligning multiple modalities as the pre-trained
  audio encoder, and introduce an Audio Q-former on top of ImageBind to learn
  reasonable auditory query embeddings for the LLM module. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6ppqs0cjs5cb8mac07gakj1))
    - Note: this is the MetaAI work that creates multi-modal embeddings - imu etc
- To align the output
  of both visual & audio encoders with LLM’s embedding space, we train Video-
  LLaMA on massive video/image-caption pairs as well as visual-instruction-tuning
  datasets of moderate amount but higher quality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6ppx12jexq7tvr7xnpv892m))
- In these frameworks, the BLIP-style
  cross-model pre-training well connects the LLMs with vision foundation models. Moreover, the
  intrinsic property of each unimodal pre-trained model, especially the instruction-following capability
  of LLMs, is preserved during vision-language pre-training. Therefore, these works empower LLMs
  to support both text-based conversations and image-grounded conversations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6pqm2cz586w7h4yn2kazryn))
- we adopt the idea of BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023a) to guarantee
  the efficiency of cross-modal pre-training. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6pqzp4tfdzw5vjmnnenz0e4))
- we
  introduce a frame embedding layer to inject temporal information and a video Q-Former to generate
  visual query tokens. As for the audio signals from the video, we additionally leverage a pre-trained
  audio encoder as well as an audio Q-former to learn reasonable auditory query embeddings ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6pr05cq9v602cfjbqst0a2p))
- For vision-language corre-
  spondence, we first pre-train the vision-related components on a large-scale video caption dataset
  with a video-clips-to-text generation task. To enhance the understanding of static visual concepts, we
  also add image-caption data into this pre-training stage. Then, we further fine-tune these components
  on a video-based conversation dataset to execute visual instruction tuning. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6s07cwdwqs25vf9hpeqkrxx))
- For the audio-language correspondence,
  we leverage Imagebind (Girdhar et al., 2023) as an encoder, which performs exceptionally well
  in aligning different modalities to a common embedding space. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6s085h3ttv5trf10sywkvxa))
- Given one
  video consists of N frames, the image encoder will first map each frame/image into Kf image
  embedding vectors, yielding video frame representations V = [v1, v2, ..., vN] where vi ∈ RKf×df
  is the set of df-dimensional image embeddings corresponding to the i-th frame. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6s0nhpedt167cb5pcd5p5cp))
- Since the frame representations vi from the frozen image encoder are computed without consider-
  ing any temporal information, we further apply position embeddings as the indicator of temporal
  information to the representations from different frames. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6s0z84vp2vcqdnrb0ytq7sv))
- We
  first uniformly sample M segments of 2-second short audio clips from the video, then convert
  each 2-second audio clip into spectrograms using 128 mel-spectrogram bins. After obtaining the
  spectrogram list of input audio, the audio encoder will map each spectrogram into a dense vector. So
  the generated audio representation of the given video can be denoted as A = [a1, a2, ..., aM]. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6s27m07g6d0qymnxgz9zxgd))
