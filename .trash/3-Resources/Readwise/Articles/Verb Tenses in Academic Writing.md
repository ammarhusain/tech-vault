## Highlights
- There are three main tenses: past, present, and future. In English, each of these tenses can take four main aspects: simple, perfect, continuous (also known as progressive), and perfect continuous. The perfect aspect is formed using the verb to have, while the continuous aspect is formed using the verb to be.
- Present simple
  used for facts, generalizations, and truths that are not affected by the passage of time
  “She writes a lot of papers for her classes.”
- In academic writing, the most commonly used tenses are the present simple, the past simple, and the present perfect.
- Present perfect
  used to describe events that began in the past and are expected to continue, or to emphasize the relevance of past events to the present moment
  “She has written papers for most of her classes, but she still has some papers left to write.”
- Tenses locate an event in time, while aspects communicate durations and relationships between events that happen at different times.
- Present perfect continuous
  used to describe events that started in the past and continue into the present or were recently completed, emphasizing their relevance to the present moment
  “She has been writing a paper all night, and now she needs to get some sleep.”
- The present simple is the most commonly used tense in academic writing, so if in doubt, this should be your default choice of tense. There are two main situations where you always need to use the present tense.
    - Note: 1. Describing facts, generalizations, and explanations
      Light travels faster than sound.
      2. Describing the content of a text
      In The History of Sexuality, Foucault asserts that sexual identity is a modern invention.
- The present perfect is used mainly to describe past research that took place over an unspecified time period. You can also use it to create a connection between the findings of past research and your own work.
    - Note: Many researchers have investigated the effects of poverty on health.
      As Monbiot (2013) has shown, ecological change is closely linked to social and political processes.
- Present, past, and future continuous
  The continuous aspect is not commonly used in academic writing. It tends to convey an informal tone, and in most cases, the present simple or present perfect is a better choice.
