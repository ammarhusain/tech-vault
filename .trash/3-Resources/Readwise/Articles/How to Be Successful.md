## Highlights
- It’s important to move towards a career that has a compounding effect—most careers progress fairly linearly.
  You don't want to be in a career where people who have been doing it for two years can be as effective as people who have been doing it for twenty—your rate of learning should always be high. As your career progresses, each unit of work you do should generate more and more results. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxp10ywhfqefez1y657cr4mv))
- Most people get bogged down in linear opportunities. Be willing to let small opportunities go to focus on potential step changes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxp11sk8c279ya638jt5352y))
- In a world where almost no one takes a truly long-term view, the market richly rewards those who do.
  Trust the exponential, be patient, and be pleasantly surprised. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxp13b3g4v34xmc97wkd4kq7))
- As you get more data points that your judgment is good and you can consistently deliver results, trust yourself more.
  If you don’t believe in yourself, it’s hard to let yourself have contrarian ideas about the future. But this is where most value gets created ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxp16qxhdj4p6cqgtfp382c9))
- Truth-seeking is hard and often painful, but it is what separates self-belief from self-delusion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxp165q0dcz809rkf8hyccfh))
- “I will fail many times, and I will be really right once” is the entrepreneurs’ way. You have to give yourself a lot of chances to get lucky.
  One of the most powerful lessons to learn is that you can figure out what to do in situations that seem to have no solution. The more times you do this, the more you will believe it. Grit comes from learning you can get back up after you get knocked down. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxp1a1w7jaxm8g672sf39wbx))
- All great careers, to some degree, become sales jobs. You have to evangelize your plans to customers, prospective employees, the press, investors, etc. This requires an inspiring vision, strong communication skills, some degree of charisma, and evidence of execution ability. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxp1cfejppcnzky1wdvt3wqr))
- Most people overestimate risk and underestimate reward. Taking risks is important because it’s impossible to be right all the time—you have to try many things and adapt quickly as you learn more. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxp1g3cvcmjcvgc64tbwwayx))
- people have an incredible ability to always match their lifestyle to next year’s salary ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxp1fnbct4fg7j968yzvx0he))
- But when you aren’t on the treadmill, you can follow your hunches and spend time on things that might turn out to be really interesting. Keeping your life cheap and flexible for as long as you can is a powerful way to do this, but obviously comes with tradeoffs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxp1fghs1z6wfwz50zxvv267))
- Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.
  Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxp1hk8pnnasyxcsvg7mn39f))
- Extreme people get extreme results. Working a lot comes with huge life trade-offs, and it’s perfectly rational to decide not to do it. But it has a lot of advantages. As in most cases, momentum compounds, and success begets success. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxp1p5c7qxqrhrjnnf91x3k7))
- To be willful, you have to be optimistic—hopefully this is a personality trait that can be improved with practice. I have never met a very successful pessimistic person. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxp1rkya0t9mkyrdky7n2h72))
- The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. For example, you can do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields. There are many other strategies, but you have to figure out some way to do it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxp1spt33p36t8dj3hhwkh1k))
- Developing a network of talented people to work with—sometimes closely, sometimes loosely—is an essential part of a great career. The size of the network of really talented people you know often becomes the limiter for what you can accomplish.
  An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxp22pp1aadqk86x5tjykpmh))
- You get truly rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxp23bsgrgfsr4h58wh8smgk))
- The most successful people I know are primarily internally driven; they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxp26294jqayq4vbs0jx7d75))
