## Highlights
- When it comes to product reviews or recipes, Brereton argued, results from Google’s search engine “have gone to shit.” Rather than settling for the default, those who want to know what a “genuine real-life human being” thinks of a certain product have learned work-arounds, such as adding “Reddit” to their searches to bring up relevant threads on that platform.
- The Marginalia results would not help you choose a new appliance, but they are a fascinating glimpse into how much material the Internet contains, and how much never makes it to the top of current Google results.
