## Highlights
- People who are indispensable at work are skilled at getting the right things done, navigating collaborative relationships, and performing their work well. As organizations break down silos, leaders expect employees to collaborate not only with their peers, but also up and down the chain of command and across different functional areas. Everyone is now a customer.
- To develop real influence, you must serve others, get things done, and add value. These are the characteristics of go-to people, who do their jobs well, have a positive attitude, and take personal responsibility. The more you serve others, the more influence you’ll gain. To develop real influence, you must know what’s required and what’s allowed, know when to say “no” and how to say “yes,” professionalize your work, and finish what you start.
- Find and use job aids whenever possible. Job aids promote alignment with your supervisor. You can also use them to manage your customers’ expectations. Sharing job aids like checklists can increase your colleagues’ productivity and generate alignment with cross-functional partners.
