Full Title: NFTs That Think | the Generalist

## Highlights
- We will see NFTs with greater narrative weight. So far, "profile picture" (pfp) NFTs have focused on physical traits. That makes them visually searchable, but doesn't give creations true personality. To address that, we may see NFT creators give their characters interior attributes that reflect an identity full of motivations, conflicts, and secrets.The Generalist has a new experiment. Philosophical Foxes are an attempt to add dimensionality and narrative to NFTs. Rather than physical traits, foxes are made unique by the philosophies, virtues, baggage, and secrets they posses. These are pixels with inner lives.
