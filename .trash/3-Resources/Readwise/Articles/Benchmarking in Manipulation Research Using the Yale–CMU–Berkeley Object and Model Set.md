## Highlights
- Benchmarks are crucial for the progress of a research field, al-
  lowing performance to be quantified to give insight into the ef-
  fectiveness of an approach compared with alternative
  methods. In manipulation research, particularly in robotic ma-
  nipulation, benchmarking and performance metrics are chal-
  lenging due largely to the enormous breadth of the application
  and task space researchers are working toward. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gppregzsgv279v8a2ymqs3x3))
- we present an object set for robotic manipula-
  tion research and performance evaluation, a framework for
  standard task protocols, and a number of example protocols
  along with experimental implementation. The object set is
  specifically designed to allow for widespread dissemination of
  the physical objects and manipulation scenarios. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpprbcb3djw4zake0n4rkrz0))

- The objects in the set are divid-
  ed into the following categories: 1) food items, 2) kitchen
  items, 3) tool items, 4) shape items, and 5) task items tests are
  also provided. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpps8653xkwhdp8j9kbh7wvj))
- we included objects that have a wide variety of shapes,
  sizes, transparencies, deformabilities, and textures. Considering
  size, the necessary grasp aperture varies from 14 cm (the diam-
  eter of the soccer ball) to 0.64 cm (the diameter of the smallest
  washer). Considering deformability, we have rigid objects to-
  gether with foam bricks, a sponge, deformable balls, and articu-
  lated objects. Regarding transparency, we have included a
  transparent plastic wine glass, a glass skillet lid, and a semitrans-
  parent bottle of glass cleaner. The set includes objects with uni-
  form plain textures, such as the pitcher and the stacking cups,
  and objects with irregular textures, like most of the groceries. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gppsg81p57r1amwms1rcfns5))
- five categories of infor-
  mation are introduced for defining manipulation protocols,
  i.e., 1) task description, 2) setup description, 3) robot/ ... hardware/subject description, 4) procedure, and 5) execution
  constraints.
- The protocol uses the pitch-
  er and the mug of YCB object and model set and provides
  scenarios by specifying ten initial configurations of the pitch-
  er and the mug. By standardizing the objects and providing
  detailed initial state information, it aims at maintaining a
  common basis of comparison between different research
  groups. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpptq762q462r21y0smprdbv))
- Pick-and-place is an essential ability for service robots. The
  benchmark assesses this ability by the daily task of table set-
  ting. The protocol uses the mug, fork, knife, spoon, bowl, and
  plate of the YCB object and model set. These objects are
  placed to predefined initial locations, and the robot is expect-
  ed to replace them to specific final configurations. The bench-
  mark scores the performance of the robot by the accuracy of
  the final object poses. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpptx1wvpktpwnz955ssbn69))
- The block pick-
  and-place protocol is designed to test a robot’s ability to
  grasp small objects and transfer them to a specified location. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gppv1m68nhzwha36e9nea9nh))
