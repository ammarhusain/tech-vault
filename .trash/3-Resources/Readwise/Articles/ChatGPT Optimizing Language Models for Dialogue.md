## Highlights
- ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers. Fixing this issue is challenging, as: (1) during RL training, thereâ€™s currently no source of truth; (2) training the model to be more cautious causes it to decline questions that it can answer correctly; and (3) supervised training misleads the model because the ideal answer [depends on what the model knows](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/BgoKdAzogxmgkuuAt/behavior-cloning-is-miscalibrated), rather than what the human demonstrator knows.

    - Note: For 1 it would be interesting to plug in various source of truth generators into the sampled output. So rather than operating in language space for a mathematical expression one could extract a mathematical expression from language and plug it into a calculator. Or extract a code snippet and plug it into an interpreter or compiler
