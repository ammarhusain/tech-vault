## Highlights
- Since its founding in 2017, the NFT marketplace has grown to become the undisputed leader in the space with a share that exceeds 97%, and volume 12x that of its closest rival.
- Already this year, more than $13 billion worth of NFTs have sold, with $25 billion in annual gross merchandise volume (GMV) within touching distance should sales for the rest of the year match last quarter. Such scale not only puts OpenSea ahead of its competition but beyond traditional, web2 marketplaces. In its most recent quarterly report, Etsy reported $3.04 billion in GMV; OpenSea surpassed that in August alone.
- The experience at CourseKick stoked an entrepreneurial obsession for both men, though it would take Finzer longer to find a project in which his talents fully flourished. After graduating, he headed to Pinterest, working as an engineer on a growth team. Less than two years later, he had decided to build something of his own yet again.
- Wificoin was in keeping with projects that had gained prominence in the space. In exchange for sharing access to a wifi router, users could earn coins, that could, in turn, be used to buy wifi access from others in the company’s network. In that respect, it was not dissimilar to Helium, a network sharing platform built on the blockchain that had raised an impressive Series B from Google Ventures, the year before.
- How does ERC-721 play into this? Think of it as the underlying infrastructure for projects like CryptoKitties. What’s important to know here is that ERC-721 is also the infrastructure for many projects beyond CryptoKitties. So if you could build a marketplace on top of ERC-721, you could easily support other NFTs.
- In particular, the company’s dominance seems to have been aided by the ease of listing, breadth of assets on the platform, and robust filtering and cataloging system.
- Launching an NFT on OpenSea, whether that be an image or song, takes just a few clicks.
- People under-appreciate how important search and discovery is for NFTs. Each NFT project (e.g. Meebits, Lost Poets) needs custom search filters by attributes, which has to be added manually by OpenSea on a project-by-project basis. This creates a huge defensible UX moat for OpenSea that’s hard for other platforms to replicate.
- Atallah was also characterized as having his ear to the ground of the crypto ecosystem, “living in Discords,” an activity that contributes to a keen sense for users’ needs. Like Finzer, he is apparently relatively conservative, with both described as “more risk-averse than the average founder.” If there’s an obvious weakness in their leadership this is it.
- The Law of Fluid Power. Crypto operates antithetically to extant power structures, seeing traditional hierarchies as unearned and illegitimate. This can relate to long-surviving institutions like the traditional financial system or newer companies like Coinbase.
- The Law of Fluid Wealth. Similarly, the crypto world is skeptical of rent-seeking entities. Organizations that do not provide continuous value and effort, earning under the same rules as every other participant, are often considered compromised. Crypto wants wealth to be fluid, rewarding sustained value creation.
- It’s very difficult for OpenSea to be forked and vampire attacked. That’s because 99% of the engineering work is off-chain (e.g. search and discovery, infrastructure) and thus can’t be forked.
- I think there’s a place for both centralized and decentralized marketplaces in the same way that Coinbase and Uniswap are both successful. OpenSea is here to stay and will offer great onboarding, UI, and useful features.
- Ultimately, while OpenSea does an excellent job of adapting itself to serve different NFTs, projects that devote significant resources to building a specialized platform will be hard to keep pace with. Finzer’s company will hope it can grow increasingly robust, win through its selection, and continue to host the long-tail of publishers unable or unwilling to create a custom solution.
- Supporting Solana should be high on the list. The project has broken out over the past year (explained well in Not Boring’s “Solana Summer”) and seemingly has room to run. Its low fees and fast transaction processing may make it a good fit for NFTs, with a range of chain-specific apes, cats, and chihuahuas emerging, and a marketplace, Solanart, serving as the aggregator.
- Looking further ahead, “intelligent” NFTs could represent another frontier. Nystom outlined this opportunity: We can expect the evolution of NFTs from merely static to dynamic aka “intelligent” NFTs with AI integrations and other cool features that evolve based on NFT usage.This is heady stuff, with the only true boundaries being legal and technical. We may, someday in the future, buy avatars with “real” personalities, with thoughts that change and adapt.
- Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson once said that “A great man is always willing to be little.”
