## Highlights
- [MT-Opt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08212), a new multi-task RL system for automated data collection and multi-task RL training, and [Actionable Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07749), which leverages the acquired data for [goal-conditioned](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2018/09/06/rig/) RL. MT-Opt introduces a scalable data-collection mechanism that is used to collect over 800,000 episodes of various tasks on real robots and demonstrates a successful application of multi-task RL that yields ~3x average improvement over baseline. Additionally, it enables robots to master new tasks quickly through use of its extensive multi-task dataset (new task fine-tuning in <1 day of data collection). Actionable Models enables learning in the absence of specific tasks and rewards by training an implicit model of the world that is also an actionable robotic policy.

    - Note: nothing too novel i think
