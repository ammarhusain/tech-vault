## Highlights
- Hierarchies of importance break down, freeing you to look everywhere for insight. The sense of possibility starts to increase as you realize the quality of the final output has very little to do with the brilliance of the original idea.

It is not fully under my control, but that means it is released from the bottlenecks of my time, my intelligence, and my attention. I am the conductor, not the whole orchestra.Building systems for externalizing your thinking is not about better, faster, stronger. It is about getting out of your own way, gaining more control by letting go of inferior forms of control.
