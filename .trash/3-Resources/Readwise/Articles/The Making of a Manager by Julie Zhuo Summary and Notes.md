## Highlights
- Your role as a manager is not to do the work yourself, even if you are the best at it, because that will only take you so far. Your role is to improve the purpose, people, and process of your team to get as high a multiplier effect on your collective outcome as you can.
- Play the role of coach. It might feel weird or uncomfortable at first. Here are some questions that you might want to ask - What do you want to be working toward in a year’s time? What do you consider your strengths? What are the ways in which you'd like to be supported?
- Why would people not be motivated to do great work? Maybe they don't have a clear picture of what great looks like. Maybe the role doesn't speak to their aspirations. Maybe they think nothing will change if they put in more effort.
- 1:1s should be focused on your report and what would help him be more successful, not on you and what you need. If you’re looking for a status update, use another channel. Rare one-on-one face time is better spent on topics that are harder to discuss in a group or over email.
- The ideal 1:1 leaves your report feeling that it was useful for her. If she thinks that the conversation was pleasant but largely unmemorable, then you can do better.
- Your job as a manager isn’t to dole out advice —it’s to empower your report to find the answer herself. She has more context than you on the problems she’s dealing with, so she’s in the best position to uncover the solution. Let her lead the 1:1 while you listen and probe.
- Set clear expectations at the beginning. Define what great looks like, compared to a mediocre / bad job. Give some advice for helping them get started on the right foot. Give task-specific feedback as frequently as you can.
- t the end of a conversation, consider asking "okay, let's make sure we're on the same page. What are your takeaways and next steps?" Consider summarising by email what you discussed. Writing helps clarify points, and you can reference them in future.
- What makes good meetings? They're simple and straightforward. You leave feeling that the meeting was a great use of your time. You learned something new that'll help you be more effective. You left with a clear sense of what to do next. Everyone was engaged. You felt welcome.
