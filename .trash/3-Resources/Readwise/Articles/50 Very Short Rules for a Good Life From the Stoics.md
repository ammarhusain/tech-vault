## Highlights
- 1. Focus on what you can control.
- 7. Remember you have the power to have no opinion.
- 15. Don’t compare yourself to others.
- 21. Focus on process, not outcomes.
- 46. Accept success without arrogance, handle failure with indifference.
- Don’t talk about it, be about it. The whole point of Stoicism is what you do. It’s who you are. It’s the act of virtue, not the act of talking about virtue.
