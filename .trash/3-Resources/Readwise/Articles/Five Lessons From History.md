## Highlights
- People suffering from sudden, unexpected hardship are likely to adopt views they previously thought unthinkable.
- Reversion to the mean occurs because people persuasive enough to make something grow don’t have the kind of personalities that allow them to stop before pushing too far.
- Jason Zweig summed this up so well: “Being right is the enemy of staying right because it leads you to forget the way the world works.”
- Unsustainable things can last longer than you anticipate.
- Progress happens too slowly for people to notice; setbacks happen too fast for people to ignore.
