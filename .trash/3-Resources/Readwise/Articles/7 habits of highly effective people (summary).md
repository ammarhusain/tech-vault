## Highlights
- Aristotle, “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.”
- If we think our lives are a function of our conditions, it is because we have, by conscious decision or by default, chosen to empower those things to have control over us - we have let ourselves become reactive. Reactive people are often affected by the weather, proactive people carry their own weather with them.
- As you become more proactive, you will make mistakes. While we choose our actions freely, we cannot choose their consequences - which are governed by natural law, out in our circle of concern. The proactive approach to a mistake is to acknowledge it instantly, correct it, and learn from it. To delay, to deny the mistake, is to miss its lesson. “Success,” said IBM founder T.J. Watson Sr., “is on the far side of failure.”
- Succeed at home first; Seek and merit divine help; Remember the people involved; Develop one new proficiency a year, Hustle while you wait; Keep a sense of humor.
- Being pleasure centered cheats one of lasting satisfactions. Too much time spent at leisure, on the paths of least resistance, ensure that our mind and spirit become lethargic, and our heart unfulfilled.
- As Peter Drucker has pointed out, the expression “time management” is something of a misnomer: We have a constant amount of time, no matter what we do; the challenge we face is to manage ourselves. To be an effective manager of yourself, you must organize and execute around priorities.
- Listen to your colleagues, family, friends, customers - but not with intent to reply, to convince, to manipulate. Listen simply to understand, to see how the other party sees things. The skill to develop here is empathy. Empathy is not sympathy. Sympathy is a form of agreement, a judgment. The essence of empathic listening is not that you agree with someone; it’s that you fully understand him, emotionally and intellectually.
- Taking care of your spiritual dimension renews your core, your center, your commitment to all your principles. People do this in a variety of ways. Some meditate on the scriptures. Others immerse themselves in great literature or music, or commune with nature. To become strong, renew the spirit.
