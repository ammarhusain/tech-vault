## Highlights
- There are three ingredients in great work: natural ability,
  practice, and effort. You can do pretty well with just two, but to
  do the best work you need all three: you need great natural ability
  and to have practiced a lot and to be trying very hard.
- It's straightforward to work hard if you have clearly defined,
  externally imposed goals, as you do in school. There is some technique
  to it: you have to learn not to lie to yourself, not to procrastinate
  (which is a form of lying to yourself), not to get distracted, and
  not to give up when things go wrong.
- Now, when I'm not working hard, alarm
  bells go off. I can't be sure I'm getting anywhere when I'm working
  hard, but I can be sure I'm getting nowhere when I'm not, and it
  feels awful.
- That limit varies depending on the type of work and the person.
  I've done several different kinds of work, and the limits were
  different for each. My limit for the harder types of writing or
  programming is about five hours a day. Whereas when I was running
  a startup, I could
  work all the time.
- you have to notice when you're
  being lazy, but also when you're working too hard. And if you think
  there's something admirable about working too hard, get that idea
  out of your head. You're not merely getting worse results, but
  getting them because you're showing off — if not to other people,
  then to yourself.
- Some people figure out what to do as children and
  just do it, like Mozart. But others, like Newton, turn restlessly
  from one kind of work to another. Maybe in retrospect we can identify
  one as their calling — we can wish Newton spent more time on math
  and physics and less on alchemy and theology — but this is an
  illusion induced by hindsight bias. 
  There was no voice calling to him that he could have heard.
- Working hard is not just a dial you turn up to 11. It's a complicated,
  dynamic system that has to be tuned just right at each point. You
  have to understand the shape of real work, see clearly what kind
  you're best suited for, aim as close to the true core of it as you
  can, accurately judge at each moment both what you're capable of
  and how you're doing, and put in as many hours each day as you can
  without harming the quality of the result. This network is too
  complicated to trick. But if you're consistently honest and
  clear-sighted, it will automatically assume an optimal shape, and
  you'll be productive in a way few people are.
