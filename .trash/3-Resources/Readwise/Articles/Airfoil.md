## Highlights
- The quite informal description of these balances that I’ve presented can be formalized mathematically using the [*Navier–Stokes equations*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations). These equations describe the motion of liquids and gasses, collectively known as [*fluids*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid), subject to various forces like gravity, or, most importantly for us, pressure.

- Navier–Stokes equations are [*notoriously difficult*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_existence_and_smoothness) to solve analytically, but a lot of insight about the behavior of fluids can be gained with computer simulations with various degrees of complexity.

- Initially, the **lift** force indeed keeps increasing with the **angle of attack**, but at some point [it plateaus](https://ciechanow.ski/#). Once that *critical* angle of attack is surpassed, the **lift** force [starts to fall](https://ciechanow.ski/#) after the flow [fully develops](https://ciechanow.ski/#).
  What we’re witnessing here is known as a [*stall*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stall_(fluid_dynamics)). The onset of a stall imposes limits on how much **lift** the wings of an airplane can generate from merely increasing the angle of attack.

- In our discussion of the motion of air around an airfoil, we’ve seen how the flow, the pressure field, and the shape of the body have effects on each other. These influences can be quite dynamic in nature, with distributions of velocity and pressure swinging back and forth in a never-ending fight for dominance.

- with further decrease in viscosity, the flow [can develop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8zKWaxohng) full featured [*turbulence*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence) in which highly irregular and chaotic mixing motions occur at different scales. Turbulent flow stands in contrast to [*laminar flow*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow), in which neighboring areas of fluid move in an orderly way past each other without any varying fluctuations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdajk3s2jyy88d732e2hd4ey))
- The Reynolds number also “predicts” the onset of turbulence. When we increase the speed of the flow **u**, or decrease the viscosity **μ**, the Reynolds number rises. When it reaches a high enough value, turbulence is likely to occur. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdak697rxh64pa6yhg6fe2y4))
- While symmetric airfoils are sometimes used in acrobatic airplanes, which often find themselves flying upside down, most typical planes use an asymmetric airfoil shape. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdjkqhhzjray3541k06qwraj))
