## Highlights
- In his essay *Meditations on First Philosophy* (1641), it occurs to him that everything he knows might turn out to be false, since it’s based on information that initially came to him through his senses, and our senses can sometimes deceive us. He set about rejecting absolutely everything he thought he knew, with the aim of allowing back in only those beliefs that he could be absolutely certain are not mistaken. Eventually – and famously – he arrives at one undeniable truth: that he exists. ‘I think, therefore I am’ expresses Descartes’s observation that, as long as he has thoughts, he can be sure that he exists.
  You don’t need to throw away everything you believe, Descartes-style. But you could benefit greatly from taking an audit of your most deeply held beliefs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghp253x3dxkrrp5jzsjrcxt3))
- The 18th-century philosopher Immanuel Kant distinguished between *noumena* (things-in-themselves) and *phenomena* (things as they appear to observers). We can never know noumena, according to Kant; we can know only phenomena. And what we perceive when we perceive phenomena is as much about us, and the spin we put on reality and our interaction with it, as it is about the world itself. ... This distinction between the world we perceive and the world in itself underpins the entire sub-field of philosophy known as [*phenomenology*](https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-do-the-phenomenological-reduction-with-edmund-husserl).

- American philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine argued that our beliefs don’t stand or fall depending on some objective test of their veracity; they stand or fall depending on how well they cohere with our other beliefs – and, when our beliefs conflict, it’s not always clear which we should reject, and which (if any) we should keep. To express this in our ‘filtering reality’ terminology: let go of any expectation that there is a ‘correct’ way to filter reality.

- [Aristotle](https://aeon.co/essays/what-can-aristotle-teach-us-about-the-routes-to-happiness) wrote about the process of developing the right character traits, or virtues, and he recognised that this could take years of work, supported by immersing oneself in the right sort of community and following the right sort of role models. The key here is to be patient with yourself. Accept what you uncover about yourself. Feelings do change, with time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gme8yn556jgzc7j3bh2fmptx))
