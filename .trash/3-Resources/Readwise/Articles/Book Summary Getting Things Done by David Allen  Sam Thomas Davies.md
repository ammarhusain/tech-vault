## Highlights
- Overwhelm comes from not clarifying what your intended outcome is, not deciding what the very next action is, and not reminding yourself of your intended outcome and action. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297521))

- Your mind is for having ideas, not for holding them. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297528))
- Getting things done requires defining what “done” means and what “doing” looks like. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297531))
- We need to transform all the ‘stuff’ we attract and accumulate into a clear inventory of meaningful actions, projects, and usable information. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297547))
- If an action will take less than two minutes, it should be done at the moment it is defined. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297555))
- You need to control commitments, projects, and actions in two ways:
  Horizontally. Maintaining coherence across all the activities in which you are involved
  Vertically. Managing thinking, development, and coordination of individual topics and projects. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297575))

- There is usually an inverse relationship between how much something is on your mind and how much it’s getting done. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297589))
- There is no reason to ever have the same thought twice unless you like having that thought. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297591))

- The Five Steps of Mastering Workflow
  Capture. Collect what has your attention
  Clarify. Process what it means
  Organize. Put it where it belongs
  Reflect. Review frequently
  Engage. Simply do. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297592))
- The Three Requirements to Make the Capturing Phase Work
  Every open loop must be in your capture system and out of your head
  You must have as few capturing buckets as you can get by with
  You must empty them regularly ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297602))

- If it is not actionable, there are three possibilities:
  Trash. It’s no longer needed.
  Incubate. No action is needed now, but something might need to be done later.
  Reference. The item is potentially useful information that might be needed for something later. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297635))

- If it is actionable, you have three options:
  Do it. If an action will take less than two minutes, it should be done at the moment it is defined.
  Delegate it. If the action will take longer than two minutes, ask yourself, “Am I the right person to do this?” If the answer is no, delegate it to the appropriate entity.
  Defer it. If the action will take longer than two minutes, and you are the right person to do it, you will have to defer acting on it until later and track it on one or more “Next Actions” lists. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297639))
- Being organized means simply that where something is matches what it means to you. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297845))

- Next Actions lists, which, along with the calendar, are at the heart of daily action-management organization and orientation. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297871))
- There are three things go on your calendar:
  Time-specific actions. This is a fancy name for appointments.
  Day-specific actions. These are things that you need to do sometimes on a certain day, but not necessarily at a specific time.
  Day-specific information. The calendar is also the place to keep track of things you want to know about on specific days—not necessarily actions you’ll have to take but rather information that may be useful on a certain date. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297873))

- All of your Projects, active project plans, and Next Actions, Agendas, Waiting For, and even Someday/Maybe lists should be reviewed once a week. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297901))

- The Weekly Review is the time to:
  Gather and process all your stuff
  Review your system
  Update your lists
  Get clean, clear, current, and complete. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297904))
- No-action systems fall into three categories:
  Trash: This is self-evident.
  Incubation: These are things that require no immediate action but are worth keeping. There are two kinds of incubation tools (i) Someday/Maybe lists and (ii) a tickler system. Someday/Maybe items are of the nature of “projects I might want to do, but not now … but I’d like to be reminded of them regularly.” A tickler system is for items that you don’t want or need to be reminded of until some designated time in the future.
  Reference: Reference systems generally take two forms: (1) topic- and area-specific storage, and (2) general reference files. The first types usually define themselves in terms of how they are stored. The second type of reference system is one that everyone needs close at hand for storing ad hoc information that doesn’t belong in some predesigned larger category.

- The Threefold Model for Identifying Daily Work
  When you’re getting things done, or “working” in the universal sense, there are three different kinds of activities you can be engaged in:
  Doing predefined work. When you’re doing predefined work, you’re working from your Next Actions lists and calendar—completing tasks that you have previously determined need to be done, or managing your workflow.
  Doing work as it shows up. Every day brings surprises and you’ll need to expend some time and energy on many of them. However, when you follow these leads, you’re deciding by default that these things are more important than anything else you have to do at those times.
  Defining your work. Defining your work entails clearing up your in-tray, your digital messages, and your meeting notes, and breaking down new projects into actionable steps. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297961))

- Ground: Current Actions. This is the accumulated list of all the actions you need to take.
  Horizon 1: Current Projects. These are the relatively short-term outcomes you want to achieve (e.g. organizing a sales conference).
  Horizon 2: Areas of Focus and Accountabilities. These are the key areas of your life and work within which you want to achieve results and maintain standards.
  Horizon 3: Goals. These are thing you’d like to accomplish or have in place, which could add importance to certain aspects of your life and diminish others.
  Horizon 4: Vision. What do you want your life and work to look like in three to five years? Decisions at this altitude can easily change what your work might look like on many levels.
  Horizon 5: Purpose and Principles. This is the big-picture view. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297975))
- The key ingredients of relaxed control are:
  Clearly defined outcomes (projects) and the next actions required to move them toward closure
  Reminders placed in a trusted system that is reviewed regularly. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297981))

- Often the only way to make a hard decision is to come back to the purpose of what you’re doing. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297988))
- One of the most powerful life skills and one of the most important to hone and develop for both professional and personal success is creating clear outcomes. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16297990))
- The big secret to efficient creative and productive thinking and action is to put the right things in your focus at the right time. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16298003))

- You can only feel good about what you’re not doing when you know everything you’re not doing. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16298007))
- The in-tray is a processing station, not a storage bin. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16298015))
- There are seven primary types of things that you’ll want to keep track of and manage from an organizational and operational perspective:
  A Projects list
  Project support material
  Calendar actions and information
  Next Actions lists
  A Waiting For list
  Reference material
  A Someday/Maybe list ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16298180))
- [It] is whatever you need to do to get your head empty again and get oriented for the next couple of weeks. It’s going through the steps of workflow management—capturing, clarifying, organizing, and reviewing all your outstanding commitments, intentions, and inclinations—until you can honestly say, “I absolutely know right now everything I’m not doing but could be doing if I decided to.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409629167/16298186))
