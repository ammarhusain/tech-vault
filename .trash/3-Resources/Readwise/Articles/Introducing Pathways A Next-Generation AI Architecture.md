## Highlights
- Pathways could enable multimodal models that encompass vision, auditory, and language understanding simultaneously. So whether the model is processing the word “leopard,” the sound of someone saying “leopard,” or a video of a leopard running, the same response is activated internally: the concept of a leopard. The result is a model that’s more insightful and less prone to mistakes and biases.
- Today's AI models are typically trained to do only one thing. Pathways will enable us to train a single model to do thousands or millions of things.
- Today's models are dense and inefficient. Pathways will make them sparse and efficient.
