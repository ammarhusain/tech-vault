## Highlights
- We can divide current models in AI into two classes: neural-network models and representation-based models.
- The problem is that we are currently asking neural networks to do too much, especially in the area of natural language processing. Words are not pixels, they are the minimal hints that a listener needs for understanding in a particular context. Pixels come from dumb sensors, but as we have seen, words come from people with rich models of both the world and likely listeners.
- To build these representation-based models, we could directly try to encode patterns of experience, sometimes called schemas [21], scripts [22], or frames [23].
- Making progress on neural-network models will require that researchers perform a search over architectures, and making progress with representation-based models will require a search over learning methods.
- We can also measure understanding by having the AI show us directly how it represents what we have told it. This means that in addition to creating simulations to train AI, we can have the AI create simulations to show us how well it understands. We could have the AI read childrenâ€™s stories and depict what it sees by creating a simulation.
- We have much of the infrastructure for this already. Pixar has open-sourced a language for describing computer-animated scenes and NVIDIA has built mature tooling around it, and we can vary the difficulty depending on the kinds of assets (primitives) we give it.
- Once the AI has learned rich and deep models down to image schemas and is able to compose them to understand the world as well as a child, it can start reading textbooks and watching videos to learn more.
