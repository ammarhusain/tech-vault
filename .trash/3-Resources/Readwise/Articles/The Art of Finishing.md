## Highlights
- There’s a certain comfort in the realm of infinite possibility. When a project is ongoing, it can be anything. It’s Schrödinger’s[1](https://www.bytedrum.com/posts/art-of-finishing#user-content-fn-schrodinger) project — simultaneously perfect and flawed until you actually finish it and put it out into the world. The moment you declare a project “done,” you open it up to criticism, both external and internal. What if it’s not good enough? What if I missed something crucial?

- The illusion of productivity plays a significant role too. As long as you’re working on something, you feel productive. Jumping from project to project gives you a constant stream of “new project energy,” which can feel more invigorating than the grind of finishing a single project. It’s a way of avoiding difficult decisions that come with completion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7nzcvjcfcpbc2hpmp9we921))
- In our professional lives, deadlines force us to prioritize and make pragmatic decisions. But in personal projects, the luxury of unlimited time can become a curse, allowing us to justify spending hours, days, or even weeks on minor details that, in reality, make little difference to the project’s overall success or usefulness. It’s a stark reminder that sometimes, “good enough” truly is perfect, especially when the alternative is never finishing at all.

- Paradoxically, sometimes we fear success as much as failure. A successful project might lead to increased expectations, more responsibility, or a change in identity that we’re not quite ready for. The unfinished project becomes a safety net, protecting us from the unknown consequences of success. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7nzf7t9gsns7qdb53e217q5))
- There’s a unique satisfaction in seeing a project through to completion that no amount of starting can match. Moreover, unfinished projects carry a mental weight. They linger in the back of your mind, quietly draining your mental energy and enthusiasm. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7nzjcwsqv430q8evxt8y7ah))
- Starting teaches us about ideation and initial implementation. Finishing, on the other hand, teaches us about perseverance, attention to detail, and the art of knowing when to let go. These are invaluable skills that can only be honed through the act of completion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7nzhs20wbft5v4jttk1z2bh))
- While starting projects might expose you to new technologies or concepts, it’s in the act of finishing — of solving those last, trickiest problems — where real *skill growth* often occurs. Each unfinished project can chip away at your confidence. Over time, you might start to doubt your ability to complete anything substantial, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of incompletion.

- Perhaps most importantly, you deny yourself the incomparable feeling of satisfaction when you release a finished project into the world. There’s a *joy in shipping* that can’t be replicated by starting something new. Finished projects also invite feedback, and without shipping, you miss out on valuable insights from users or peers that could significantly improve your skills and future projects.

- **Define “Done” from the Start**: Before diving into a project, I’ll clearly define what “finished” looks like. What are the core features that constitute a complete project? I’ll write them down and resist the urge to expand this list as I go. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7nzp1mmpzgvf6bj327qggps))
