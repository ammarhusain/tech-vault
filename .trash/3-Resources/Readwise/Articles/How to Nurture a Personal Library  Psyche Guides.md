## Highlights
- The paradox of the library in our time is that it aspires to be vast but is also selective and bounded – a tiny droplet of material in a seemingly limitless sea of content. By collecting a library, you’re setting boundaries on the boundless.
- It’s a form of escape, too – a step out of the ceaselessly churning, self-refreshing timeline, into a space where books from different times and places press up against each other, having the most fascinating conversations, like the guests at one of those fantasy dinner parties where you can invite anyone you like, living or dead.
