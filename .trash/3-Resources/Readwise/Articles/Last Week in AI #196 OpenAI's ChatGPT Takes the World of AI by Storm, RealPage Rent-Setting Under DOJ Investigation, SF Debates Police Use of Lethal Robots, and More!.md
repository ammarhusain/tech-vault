- ChatGPT, which is trained to interact in a conversational manner. The model is capable of answering follow-up questions, admitting its mistakes, challenging incorrect premises, and rejecting inappropriate requests. It has been trained using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, a method that utilizes human feedback to fine-tune AI models. ChatGPT is a sibling model to InstructGPT, which is trained to follow instructions provided in a prompt and provide a detailed response. The model is fine-tuned from GPT-3.5.
