## Highlights
- The three main types of betting odds are fractional (British) odds, decimal (European) odds, and money line (American) odds. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grfjyq1jjvh88ta6czkrqvqg))
- Britsh fractional odds are the ratio of the amount (profit) won to the stake. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grfjz0v19d3zxxrenze2vex6))
- European decimal odds represent the amount one wins for every $1 wagered. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grfjz4kq9rpppwmvymcy0qjw))
- A fractional listing of 6/1 (six-to-one) odds would mean that you win $6 against every $1 you wager and receive your dollar back (i.e., the amount you wagered). In other words, this is the ratio of the amount (profit) won to the initial bet, which means that you will receive your stake ($1) in addition to the [profit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp) ($6), resulting in a total payout of $7. Therefore, if you stake $10 at 6/1 and win, you get a total payout of $70 ($60 profit + $10 stake).
  The total (potential) return on a stake can be stated as:
  > Tp = ( S ( N / D ) ) + S ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grfk6810bfc8fpqp90qh0ct9))
- The decimal odds number represents the amount one wins for every $1 wagered. For decimal odds, the number represents the total payout rather than the profit. In other words, your stake is already included in the decimal number (no need to add back your stake), which makes its total payout calculation easier.
  The total (potential) return on a stake can be calculated as:
  > Tp = S * D ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grfkh3fvfg9r1z06vbnexgsq))
- [Money line](https://www.investopedia.com/money-line-bet-5217219) odds (aka “American” odds or “U.S.” odds) are popular in the United States. The odds for favorites are accompanied by a minus (-) sign and indicate the amount you need to stake to win $100. On the other hand, the odds for the underdogs are accompanied by a positive (+) sign and indicate the amount won for every $100 staked.

- Seven to two odds imply that every $2 wagered could win you $7 if the bet is successful. With fractional odds, the number on the left expresses how much you win, while the number on the right reveals how much you need to stake.
