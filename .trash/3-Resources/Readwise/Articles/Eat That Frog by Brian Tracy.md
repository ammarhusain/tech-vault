## Highlights
- “Your ability to choose between the important and the unimportant is the key determinant of your success in life and work.”
- Your ‘frog’ is your biggest, most important task If you have two frogs, eat the ‘ugliest’ one first If you have to eat a frog, don’t procrastinate on it
- Think about your goals and review them daily. Every morning when you begin, take action on the most important task you can accomplish to achieve your most important goal at the moment.
- In your work, having a clear idea of what is really important to you in the long term makes it much easier for you to make better decisions about your priorities in the short term.
- The difference between high performers and low performers is largely determined by what they choose to procrastinate on.
- One of the greatest questions you will ever ask yourself: “What one skill, if I developed and did it in an excellent fashion, would have the greatest positive impact on my career?”
- Make work appointments with yourself and then discipline yourself to keep them. Set aside thirty-, sixty- and ninety-minute time segments that you use to work on and complete important tasks.
