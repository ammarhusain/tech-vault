## Highlights
- I had the naïve idea that if one could build a big enough network, with enough memory loops, it might get lucky and acquire the ability to envision things in its head. This became a field of study later. It was called self-organizing random networks. Even today, I still get letters from young students who say, ‘Why are you people trying to program intelligence? Why don’t you try to find a way to build a nervous system that will just spontaneously create it?’ Finally, I decided that either this was a bad idea or it would take thousands or millions of neurons to make it work, and I couldn’t afford to try to build a machine like that.”
- But someday, according to Minsky, the most useful programs for personal computers will be based on artificial-intelligence programs that write programs of their own. The idea is for an ordinary person—not a programmer—to describe what he wants a program to do in informal terms, perhaps simply by showing the program-writing program some examples. Then it will write a computer program to do what was described—a process that will be much cheaper than hiring a professional programmer.
- The idea is that thinking is process and that if your thinking does something you don’t want it to do you should be able to say something microscopic and analytical about it, and not something enveloping and evaluative about yourself as a person. The important thing in refining your own thought is to try to depersonalize your interior; it may be all right to deal with other people in a vague, global way by having ‘attitudes’ toward them, but it is devastating if this is the way you deal with yourself.”
