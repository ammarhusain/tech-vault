## Highlights
- Productivity is often a distraction. Don’t aim for better ways to get through your tasks as quickly as possible, rather aim for better tasks that you never want to stop doing.
- What you do on your bad days matters more than what you do on your good days.
- Focus on directions rather than destinations. Who knows their destiny? But maintain the right direction and you’ll arrive at where you want to go.
- Speak confidently as if you are right, but listen carefully as if you are wrong.
- When introduced to someone make eye contact and count to 4. You’ll both remember each other.
- Prescription for popular success: do something strange. Make a habit of your weird.
- No one is as impressed with your possessions as you are.
- The only productive way to answer “what should I do now?” is to first tackle the question of “who should I become?”
- When you forgive others, they may not notice, but you will heal. Forgiveness is not something we do for others; it is a gift to ourselves.
- Efficiency is highly overrated; Goofing off is highly underrated. Regularly scheduled sabbaths, sabbaticals, vacations, breaks, aimless walks and time off are essential for top performance of any kind. The best work ethic requires a good rest ethic.
- Ask anyone you admire: Their lucky breaks happened on a detour from their main goal. So embrace detours. Life is not a straight line for anyone.
