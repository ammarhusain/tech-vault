## Highlights
- **Starting is characterized by friction, whereas the rest is characterized by fluidity.** The start of any creative endeavor is full of doubt and skepticism, which frames everything from the perspective of a *rational* mind. You tend to overanalyze things and try to figure out what you’re trying to convey before you put a single word or brushstroke down. The friction here is birthed from the sense that you don’t know what you’re doing, and this uncertainty prevents you from putting anything down.

- Flow states emerge when you’ve moved past the friction of the start and entered a domain where you believe in the beauty of what you’re creating. You don’t judge yourself for what you’re making, and you’re not questioning the way you’re putting things together. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw0t1eg6vzgpdptpkddxqx3n))
