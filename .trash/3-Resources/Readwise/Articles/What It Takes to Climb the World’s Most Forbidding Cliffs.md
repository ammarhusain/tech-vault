## Highlights
- But it’s considered bad style to talk about climbs you’re planning. The maxim is “send, then spray”—talk about it only after you do it, and only if you must.
- “I don’t really have an emotional reaction to danger,” Caldwell said. “Alex doesn’t, either, which is a big reason why we’re such good partners. The difference, though, is that he’s proud of that quality. I’m ashamed of it.”
- He has always had an air of detachment, of devotion to pure performance, that Caldwell does not. He lived in a van for ten years and did almost nothing but train and climb, and his unsentimentality is legendary, earning him the nickname Spock.
- He always tries really hard, but he’s also got this lighthearted thing, slightly removed from whatever’s stressing everybody else. His brain works really fast. We’ll be thinking about whether to move a rope or not, but he’s already doing it.
- Ondra is a competitor, built and trained to win. Caldwell is a mountain djinn, a problem solver at home in the high country.
