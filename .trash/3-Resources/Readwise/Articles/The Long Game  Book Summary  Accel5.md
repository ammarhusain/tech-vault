## Highlights
- Before you can become a long-term thinker, you’ll need to put an end to unproductive busyness and create space in your life. Start saying “no” so you can say “yes” to what matters.Find your focus. Gain clarity on your goals and how you want to achieve them to find your best path forward.
- Busyness is a status symbol, a sign that you’re sought after and in high demand. That status has powerful effects on others’ perception of who you are in the world and at work, and it can have real impacts on your self-worth. But at the same time, busyness is also numbing. It’s a means you can use to keep from feeling your feelings, sitting with your thoughts, or even exploring the unknown.
- Cycle through four specific career waves to find a productive rhythm:
  Learning: Familiarize yourself with the ideas and frameworks in your field so you can form your own perspective.
  Creating: Make a contribution to your field by sharing your ideas.
  Connecting: Build a network of people you can learn from and contribute alongside to create more value.
  Reaping: Recognize your achievements and enjoy the benefits of your work.
