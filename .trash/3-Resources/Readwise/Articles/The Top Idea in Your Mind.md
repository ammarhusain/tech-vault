## Highlights
- Everyone who's worked on difficult problems is probably familiar
  with the phenomenon of working hard to figure something out, failing,
  and then suddenly seeing the answer a bit later while doing something
  else. There's a kind of thinking you do without trying to. I'm
  increasingly convinced this type of thinking is not merely helpful
  in solving hard problems, but necessary. The tricky part is, you
  can only control it indirectly.
- Someone who does you an injury hurts you twice: first by the injury
  itself, and second by taking up your time afterward thinking about
  it. If you learn to ignore injuries you can at least avoid the
  second half. I've found I can to some extent avoid thinking about
  nasty things people have done to me by telling myself: this doesn't
  deserve space in my head. I'm always delighted to find I've forgotten
  the details of disputes, because that means I hadn't been thinking
  about them.
