## Highlights
- Profitable companies typically have market values greater than book values. Most of the companies in the top indexes meet this standard, as seen from the examples of Microsoft and Walmart mentioned above. [Growth investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/growthinvesting.asp) may find such companies promising. However, it may also indicate [overvalued](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overvalued.asp) or overbought stocks trading at high prices.

- Most publicly listed companies fulfill their capital needs through a combination of debt and equity. Companies get debt by taking loans from banks and other financial institutions or by floating interest-paying [corporate bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatebond.asp). They typically raise equity capital by listing the shares on the stock exchange through an initial public offering ([IPO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp)).

- Debt capital requires payment of interest, as well as eventual repayment of loans and bonds. However, equity capital creates no such obligation for the company. Equity investors aim for [dividend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) income or [capital gains](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp) driven by increases in stock prices.

- Creditors who provide the necessary capital to the business are more interested in the company's asset value. After all, they are mostly concerned about repayment. Therefore, creditors use book value to determine how much capital to lend to the company since assets make good [collateral](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateral.asp). The book valuation can also help to determine a company's ability to pay back a loan over a given time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grfndsbken46bb9xqya63bcj))
- investors and traders are more interested in buying or selling a stock at a fair price. When used together, market value and book value can help investors determine whether a stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grfne0e3kkhy22h5h2ccmcz2))
- larger companies within a particular industry will generally have higher book values, just as they have higher market values. Furthermore, some businesses are more profitable than others. Such firms can afford to pay a higher [dividend yield](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendyield.asp). That may justify buying a higher-priced stock with less book value per share.
