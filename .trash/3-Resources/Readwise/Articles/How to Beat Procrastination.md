- Expectancy, value, delay, and impulsiveness are the four major components of procrastination ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpka1gm2ey50ps8n93qxf2ys))
- Decrease the certainty or the size of a task's reward - its expectancy or its value - and you are unlikely to pursue its completion with any vigor. Increase the delay for the task's reward and our susceptibility to delay - impulsiveness - and motivation also dips. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpnvchrb49ny03r0vqcpr8b6))
- To beat procrastination, we need to:
  1. Increase your *expectancy* of success.
  2. Increase the task's *value* (make it more pleasant and rewarding).
  3. Decrease your *impulsiveness*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpka8z5s5x9xdfwe7f3849w7))
- *success spirals*.11 When you achieve one challenging goal after another, your obviously gain confidence in your ability to succeed. So: give yourself a series of meaningful, challenging but achievable goals, and then achieve them! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpkae5ejad09yf31dc1rv71v))
- "it is often best to have process or learning goals rather than product or outcome goals. That is, the goals are acquiring or refining new skills or steps (the process) rather than winning or getting the highest score (the product)."
