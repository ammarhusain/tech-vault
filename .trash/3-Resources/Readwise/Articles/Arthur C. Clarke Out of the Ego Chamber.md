## Highlights
- the really distinguishing feature of Clarke’s style is the sense of sadness and loneliness that man must feel over living for so brief a time in such a vast universe of which he can have so limited a glimpse. Kubrick once remarked, “Arthur somehow manages to capture the hopeless but admirable human desire to know things that can really never be known.”
- Here is Clarke describing the prehistoric earth in “The Sentinel,” the short story that was transformed into “2001”: “Such was our own Earth, the smoke of the great volcanoes still staining the skies, when that first ship of the peoples of the dawn came sliding in from the abyss beyond Pluto. It passed the frozen outer worlds, knowing that life could play no part in their destinies. It came to rest among the inner planets, warming themselves around the fire of the sun and waiting for their stories to begin.”
- When I am in the Strand, or 42nd Street, or NASA Headquarters, or the Beverly Hills Hotel . . . my surroundings are liable to give a sudden tremor, and I see through the insubstantial fabric to the reality beneath.” He concludes, “And always it is the same: the slender palm trees leaning over the white sand, the warm sun sparkling on the waves as they break on the inshore reef, the outrigger fishing boats drawn up high on the beach. This alone is real; the rest is but a dream from which I shall presently awake.”
- By 1945, Clarke was a flight lieutenant stationed a few miles from Stratford-Upon-Avon and teaching airmen to maintain the new G.C.A. system. He was also writing and selling science-fiction stories in his spare time.
- The Third, and most recently formulated, Clarke Law, which he made use of in writing the enigmatic ending of “2001,” states, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”

- Clarke is especially fond of Robert Bridges’ assertion in “The Testament of Beauty” that life consists of the “masterful administration of the unforeseen.”
