## Highlights
- Even though I love writing, I have a really hard time because I can’t separate my drafting personality from my editing personality. The editor gets in the way of the drafter. My solution here is a special Themed Review process.
  When I have a topic to write about, I quickly jot down as much as I can in my note-taking app without any filter whatsoever. If I struggle to articulate a point, I just write some shorthand and keep going. This isn’t even a first draft; it’s more like a word vomit.
  I then atomize these inchoate thoughts into individual “highlights” inside a custom book in Readwise with a working title for the ultimate essay. Once made, I set up a Themed Review drawing from this “book” plus a custom tag for the essay that I use to include relevant highlights and tweets from other sources.

- I then spend a few weeks reviewing five of these passages per morning. I’m not just reading the passages: I actively edit them for clarity of language and thought. Once I have done this for a while, I finally export the polished passages back into my note-taking app where I reorder things into a logical sequence and identify any logical gaps. I add in the connectives, edit the whole document one last time, and hit publish. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn8sw3yfa2msjxqkvceqht91))
