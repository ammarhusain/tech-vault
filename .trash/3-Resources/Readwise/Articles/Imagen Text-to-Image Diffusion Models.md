## Highlights
- Imagen builds on the power of large transformer language models in understanding text and hinges on the strength of diffusion models in high-fidelity image generation.
- Our key discovery is that generic large language models (e.g. T5), pretrained on text-only corpora, are surprisingly
  effective at encoding text for image synthesis: increasing the size of the language model in Imagen boosts both sample fidelity and image-text
  alignment much more than increasing the size of the image diffusion model.
