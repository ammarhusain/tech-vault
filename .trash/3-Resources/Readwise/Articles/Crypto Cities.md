## Highlights
- Reno, Nevada mayor Hillary Schieve is a blockchain fan, focusing primarily on the Tezos ecosystem, and she has recently been exploring blockchain-related ideas (see her podcast here) in the governance of her city: Selling NFTs to fund local art, starting with an NFT of the "Space Whale" sculpture in the middle of the city Creating a Reno DAO, governed by Reno coins that Reno residents would be eligible to receive via an airdrop. The Reno DAO could start to get sources of revenue; one proposed idea was the city renting out properties that it owns and the revenue going into a DAO Using blockchains to secure all kinds of processes: blockchain-secured random number generators for casinos, blockchain-secured voting, etc.
- But even despite all of these problems, many still find home ownership to be not just a good personal choice, but something worthy of actively subsidizing or socially encouraging. One big reason is that it nudges people to save money and build up their net worth. Another big reason is that despite its flaws, it creates economic alignment between residents and the communities they live in. But what if we could give people a way to save and create that economic alignment without the flaws? What if we could create a divisible and fungible city token, that residents could hold as many units of as they can afford or feel comfortable with, and whose value goes up as the city prospers?
