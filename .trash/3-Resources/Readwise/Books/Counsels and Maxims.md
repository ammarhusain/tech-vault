## Highlights
### General Rules
- Aristotle: *“not pleasure, but freedom from pain, is what the wise man will aim at”.*
    - Tags: #readwise/qt #readwise/favorite 
- For all pleasures are chimerical, and to mourn for having lost any of them is a frivolous, and even ridiculous proceeding.
- In moments free from pain, our restless wishes present, as it were in a mirror, the image of a happiness that has no counterpart in reality, seducing us to follow it; in doing so we bring pain upon ourselves, and that is something undeniably real.
  In seeking for these pleasures he encounters danger. He hunts for game that does not exist; and so he ends by suffering some very real and positive misfortunes.
- To desire to get rid of an evil is a definite object, but to desire a better fortune than one has is blind folly.
- For the safest way of not being very miserable is not to expect to be very happy
- Persian poem:
  Though from thy grasp all worldly things should flee, 
  Grieve not for them, for they are nothing worth:
  And though a world in thy possession be,
  Joy not, for worthless are the things of earth.

- In their search for gold, the alchemists discovered other things - gunpowder, china, medicines, the laws of nature. There is a sense in which we are all alchemists.
### Our Relation to Ourselves
- Simplicity, therefore, as far as it can be attained, and even monotony, in our manner of life, if it does not mean that we are bored, will contribute to happiness.
- It is advisable to suspend mental work for a while, if circumstances happen which demand any degree of energy in affairs of practical nature.
- A rule recommended by Pythagoras - to review, every night before going to sleep, what we have done during the day.
- The love of life is at bottom only the fear of death.
- It is the monotony of his own nature that makes a man find solitude intolerable.
- Let me advise you, then, to form the habit of taking some of your solitude with you into society, to learn to be to some extent alone even though you are in company - not to say at once what you think, and on the other hand, not to attach too precise a meaning to what others say; Rather not to expect much of them either morally or intellectually, and to strengthen yourself in the feeling of indifference to their opinion, which is the surest way of always practicing a praise worthy toleration. If you do that, you will not live so much with other people, though you may appear to move amongst them. Your relation to them will be of a purely objective character.
- Society is in this respect like a fire - the wise man warming himself at a proper distance from it; not coming too close, like the fool, who, on getting scorched, runs away and shivers in solitude, loud in his complaint that the fire burns.

- Envy is natural to man and is the enemy of our happiness. Stifle it like an evil thought.
- As regards to the envy which we excite in other people, it should be remembered that no form of hatred is so implacable as the hatred that comes from envy. They will be secretly embittered against you; and unless they are restrained by fear, they will always be anxious to let you understand that you are no better than they.
- In the case of a misfortune which has already happened and therefore cannot be altered, you should not allow yourself to think that it might have been otherwise; still less that it might have been avoided by such and such means; for reflections of this kind will only add to your distress and make it intolerable.
- We should be careful not to be over-anxious on any matter affecting our weal or our woe, not to carry our anxiety to unreasonable or injudicious limits; but coolly and dispassionately to deliberate upon the matter, as though it were an abstract question which did not touch us in particular.
- This reigning-in of the imagination which I am recommending, will also forbid us to summon up the memory of the past misfortune, to paint a dark picture of the injustice or harm that has been done to us, the losses we have sustained, the insults, slights and annoyances to which we have been exposed.
- It is most important for everyone who is capable of higher and nobler thoughts to keep their mind from being completely engrossed with private affairs and vulgar troubles. Of course for this self-control is necessary.
- A little self-control at the right moment may prevent much subsequent compulsion at the hands of others.
- Horace recommends us to study carefully and inquire diligently what will best promote a tranquil life - not to be always agitated by fruitless desires and fears and hopes for things, which, after all, are not worth very much.
- Difficilis in otio quies - It is difficult to keep quiet if you have nothing to do.
- Every month of the year has its own peculiar and direct influence upon health and bodily condition generally; nay even upon the state of the mind. It is an influence dependent upon the weather.
### Our Relation to Others
- Mephistopheles: There must be fools and rogues in the world. To become indignant at their conduct is as foolish as to be angry with a stone because it rolls into your path.
- Memory is in this respect like the lens of a camera obscura: it contracts everything within its range, and so produces a much finer picture than the actual landscape affords.
- You cannot see in another man any more than you have in yourself.

- In dealing with fools and blockheads, there is only one way of showing your intelligence - by having nothing to do with them. That means, of course, that when you go into society, you may now and then feel like a good dancer who gets an invitation to a ball, and on arriving, finds that everyone is lame :- with whom is he to dance?
- It is just as easy to flatter and win them over; and this is why their judgment is usually corrupt, and why their opinions are swayed, not by what is really true and right, but by the favor of the party or class to which they belong. In such people force of will greatly predominates over knowledge; and hence their meager intellect is wholly given up to the service of the will.
- The aim of astrology is to bring the motions of the celestial bodies into relation with the wretched Ego and to establish a connection between a comet in the sky and squabbles and rascalities on earth.
- You will not readily alienate people by being somewhat proud and careless in your behavior.
- If a man comes to think that I am more dependent upon him than he is upon me; he at once feels as though I had stolen something from him and his endeavor will be to have his vengeance and get it back.
- With most people there will be no harm in occasionally mixing a grain of disdain with your treatment of them; that will make them value your friendship all the more. Italian proverb - To disregard is to win regard.
- To forgive and forget means to throw away dearly bought experience.
- A man can see other people's shortcomings and vices, but he is blind to his own.
- He who criticises others, works at the reformation of himself.
- You should never lose sight of the fact that ordinary politeness is only a grinning mask: if it shifts its place a little, or is removed for a moment, there is no use of raising a hue and cry.
- If you feel irritated by the absurd remarks of two people whose conversation you happen to overhear, you should imagine that you are listening to a dialogue of two fools in a comedy.
- As a general rule, it is more advisable to show your intelligence by saying nothing than by speaking out; for silence is a matter of prudence, whilst speech has something in it of vanity.
- The feeling of relief which lively people experience in speaking aloud when no one is listening, should not be indulged, lest it grow into a habit; for in this way thought establishes such very friendly terms with speech, that conversation is apt to become a process of thinking aloud. Prudence exacts that a wide gulf should be fixed between what we think and what we say.
- A secret is in my custody, if I keep it; but should it escape me, it is I who am the prisoner.
- To speak without emphasizing your words is an old rule with those who are wise in the world's ways. It means that you should leave other people to discover what it is that you have said; and as their minds are slow, you can make your escape in time.
### Worldly Fortune
- When men speak of some one's success, the lot of the man who has failed is not so very different as it seems.
- A man's life is like the voyage of a ship, where luck acts the part of the wind. All that the man can do for himself is of little avail; like the rudder.

- We are compelled to modify our tactics, often to such an extent that, as we carry them out, hardly a single feature of the original plan can be recognized.
- There is no worse or more exacting usurer than Time; and if you compel Time to give money in advance, you will have to pay a rate of interest more ruinous than any Jew would require.
- Almost every one in his turn has lamented over something which afterwards turned out to be the very best thing for him that could have happened - or rejoiced at an event which became the source of his greatest sufferings.

- Always remember that our existence is full of woe and misery: and that the ills to which we are exposed are innumerable.
- He can see mankind struggling and floundering in torment - all for the sake of a wretched existence, barren and unprofitable! If he remembers this, a man will not expect very much from life, but learn to accommodate himself to a world where all is relative and no perfect state exists; - always looking misfortune in the face, and if he cannot avoid it, meeting it with courage.

- The main reason why misfortune falls less heavily upon us; if we have looked upon its occurrence as not impossible.
- If we have thought over the possibility of misfortune, we have also at the same time considered the sources to which we shall look for help and consolation; or we have accustomed ourselves to the idea of it.
- Everything that happens - from the smallest up to the greatest facts of existence - happens of necessity.
- The small troubles of every day - those little differences we have with our fellow-men, insignificant disputes, unbecoming conduct in other people, petty gossip, and many other similar annoyances of life; he should not feel them at all, much less take them to heart and brood over them. Push them out of his way, like stones that lie in the road, upon no account think about them and give them a place in his reflections.
- The most finished man of the world would be one who was never irresolute (hesitant) and never in a hurry.

- Life is one long battle; we have to fight at every step
- Our motto should be *No Surrender*; and far from yielding to the ills of life, let us take fresh courage from misfortune.
### The Ages of Life
- A young man is generally dissatisfied with the position in which he finds himself, whatever it may be; he ascribes his disappointment solely to the state of things that meets him on his first introduction to life, when he had expected something very different; whereas it is only the vanity and wretchedness of human life everywhere that he is now for the first time experiencing.
- Our first ideas of life are generally taken from fiction rather than from fact.
- The poetry of life spreads out a gorgeous vision before us, and we torture ourselves by longing to see it realized. We might as well wish to grasp the rainbow! To try and realize these visions is to make them an object of the will - a process which always involves pain.

- In our early days we fancy that the leading events in our life, and the persons who are going to play an important part in it, will make their entrance to the sound of drums and trumpets; but when, in old age, we look back, we find that they all came in quite quietly, slipped in, as it were, by the side-door, almost unnoticed.
- A man's memory is as imperfect as his intellect; and he must make a practice of reflecting upon the lessons he has learned and the events he has experienced, if he does not want them both to sink gradually into the gulf of oblivion.
- The present is the point of contact between the world as subject and the world as object. Will forms the inner reality underlying all the phenomena of life and nature, is not in itself affected by time; but that on the other hand, time is necessary for the objectification of the will.
- Sometimes we credit ourselves with a longing to be in some distant spot, whereas in truth, we are only longing to have the time back again which we spent there - days when we were younger and fresher than we are now. In those moments Time mocks us by wearing the mask of space; and if we travel to the spot, we can see how much we have been deceived.
- Almost every man's character seems to be specially suited to some one period of life, so that on reaching it the man is at his best.
- A wise/old man alone has a full sense of life's utter vanity; whilst the others never cease to labor under the false notion that everything will come right in the end.
- To be poor when one is old, is a great misfortune.
- It is advisable to put very moderate limits upon our expectations of pleasure, possessions, rank, honor and so on; because it is just this striving and struggling to be happy, to dazzle the world, to lead a life full of pleasure, which entail great misfortune. It is prudent and wise, I say, to reduce one’s claims, if only for the reason that it is extremely easy to be very unhappy;
- Care should be taken not to build the happiness of life upon a broad foundation—not to require a great many things in order to be happy
