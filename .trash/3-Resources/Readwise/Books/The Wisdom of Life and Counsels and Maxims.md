## Highlights
- ordering our lives so as to obtain the greatest possible amount of pleasure and success; an art the theory of which may be called Eudæmonology, for it teaches us how to lead a happy existence. ([Location 73](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC26NM&location=73))
- the wise in all ages have always said the same thing, and the fools, who at all times form the immense majority, have in their way too acted alike, and done just the opposite; ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC26NM&location=91))
- Voltaire says, we shall leave this world as foolish and as wicked as we found it on our arrival. ([Location 92](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC26NM&location=92))

- Epicurus, who wrote as the title of one of his chapters, The happiness we receive from ourselves is greater than that which we obtain from our surroundings ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC26NM&location=114))
- The world in which a man lives shapes itself chiefly by the way in which he looks at it, and so it proves different to different men; to one it is barren, dull, and superficial; to another rich, interesting, and full of meaning. ([Location 120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC26NM&location=120))
- Differences of rank and wealth give every man his part to play, but this by no means implies a difference of inward happiness and pleasure; here, too, there is the same being in all—a poor mortal, with his hardships and troubles. ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC26NM&location=141))
- Since everything which exists or happens for a man exists only in his consciousness and happens for it alone, the most essential thing for a man is the constitution of this consciousness, which is in most cases far more important than the circumstances which go to form its contents.

- For the highest, most varied and lasting pleasures are those of the mind, however much our youth may deceive us on this point; and the pleasures of the mind turn chiefly on the powers of the mind. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC26NM&location=158))
- Goethe, in the West-östlichen Divan, says that every man, whether he occupies a low position in life, or emerges as its victor, testifies to personality as the greatest factor in happiness:— ([Location 162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC26NM&location=162))
- Everything confirms the fact that the subjective element in life is incomparably more important for our happiness and pleasure than the objective, ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC26NM&location=172))
- For what a man is in himself, what accompanies him when he is alone, what no one can give or take away, is obviously more essential to him than everything he has in the way of possessions, or even what he may be in the eyes of the world. ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC26NM&location=177))

- A good, temperate, gentle character can be happy in needy circumstances, whilst a covetous, envious and malicious man, even if he be the richest in the world, goes miserable. Nay more; to one who has the constant delight of a special individuality, with a high degree of intellect, most of the pleasures which are run after by mankind are simply superfluous; they are even a trouble and a burden. ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC26NM&location=180))
- What a man has in himself is, then, the chief element in his happiness. ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC26NM&location=242))
- Aristotle says: It is not wealth but character that lasts. ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC26NM&location=276))
