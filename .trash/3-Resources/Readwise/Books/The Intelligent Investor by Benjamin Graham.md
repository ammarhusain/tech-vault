## Highlights
- A stock is not just a mere object you trade. It is a piece of ownership in a business. Therefore, the stock has a fundamental value that is often not the share price. Understand the business, and you understand the fundamental value. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/669e2987-0658-4012-8212-9d711a4286b2))
- The market has constant mood swings. At times, it is over-optimistic, which makes stocks too expensive. At other times, it is pessimistic, which makes stocks cheap. The key is to buy from pessimists and sell to optimists. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/850d6aa7-92eb-462a-858d-6d93032ed7f6))
- investment as an operation that, through extensive analysis, provides an adequate return and safety of principal. Everything that doesn’t fit this definition is speculation. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/06344fa7-4f59-438b-951f-b473fb277173))
- Investors look at the fundamental value of the stock, independent of the stock price. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/540d3176-2d02-4b48-94dc-98b9e1e03211))
- Aggressive investors are willing to devote serious time and energy to research stocks and select good ones. They enjoy thinking about money and see smart investing as a competitive game they want to win. Their goal is to achieve better returns than the passive investor (Graham says an extra 5% per year, before taxes, is necessary to justify all the effort.) ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/005699ed-701b-46d6-aa2d-4d465828f66b))
- avoid the delusion that you can predict the market. Zweig notes that your response to any question about the market should be “I don’t know and I don’t care.” ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/5032ed18-dbc9-474a-81c2-3179b5bb3145))
- index funds should be the default choice of most everyday investors, rather than picking individual stocks ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/5dee4ffd-7112-4fdf-b207-e06ae0160e97))
- Strong financials: Assets at least double liabilities, and working capital more than long-term debt ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/5c191c85-f980-4b32-a71a-e39482b6f9b1))
- Earnings: Positive in each of the past 10 years; no unprofitable years ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/d1ce5264-6d86-4540-9a02-e957bb0dea89))
- Earnings growth: At least 33% total growth in per-share earnings in the past 10 years (a bit less than 3% annually) ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/4df4523b-04b6-4600-ac44-e9c3d44eb78e))
- Price-to-earnings ratio: No more than 15 times the average past 3-year earnings ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/2bf1f4a5-611c-4be0-9d2a-7e387bffa21a))
- Beware of analysts who calculate a “forward P/E ratio” using not historical earnings but “next-year’s earnings.” Predictions are notoriously unreliable, and often the forward P/E ratio is used merely to justify an overpriced stock. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/f08fa9fd-c5f9-4fab-9dd6-458cbdbae60d))
- Price-to-book value ratio: No more than 150% of book value (also known as net asset value; calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets)
  In his commentary, Zweig notes that many companies today have a greater amount of value in intangible assets such as brand value and intellectual property, which don’t show up in book value. Thus, more companies are priced at higher price-to-book ratios. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/f468d4db-58d2-478e-a8f7-959016d06ac1))
- Graham’s core strategy is to find companies that are priced lower than their fair value. In other words, try to buy a dollar for far less than a dollar. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/288c0e94-618a-41e6-a1bf-5f428356564b))
- A stock with tremendous hype around growth, and high prices to match, is likely too speculative for intelligent investors. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/c13ca7e6-0662-4024-8f60-b83460c9edd5))
- A stock with tremendous hype around growth, and high prices to match, is likely too speculative for intelligent investors.
  Yet a once-hyped stock that falls dramatically in value can then turn into a bargain stock worth buying. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/9b26ce08-abe3-4e83-9262-c20c3e803afb))
- You have no obligation to act according to market fluctuations. You should deliberately choose to transact only when it is in your favor. You shouldn’t ignore Mr. Market entirely, nor should you blindly follow whatever he tells you, but rather use his prices only when it is to your advantage. You are not obligated to trade with him. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/c782dc04-2b91-4a46-8de4-8f8ddae6d1e8))
- investors should be comfortable buying stock even if they could receive zero future information about its daily stock price. Investors also trade oppositely to speculators—they buy when the market is down, since stocks are cheap. Investors dread bull markets since it makes everything overpriced. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/b2919739-8e47-4f81-8f0d-c3ce03677de3))
- Strategies that seem to work when back-tested against historical data may be illusory. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/dc6e3236-d201-4850-ac99-0a790c1a7066))
- Any simplistic strategy that mechanically picks stocks, without thorough consideration of the company’s underlying value, does not qualify as investment ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/375c8e5a-229b-4ab6-904f-6289cb798a54))
- How do brokerages with zero commissions make money through trading? By selling order flow to market makers, who profit from inexperienced investors. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/004335f3-b30a-4651-9d29-8a612ea39430))
- “active trading is hazardous to your wealth.” ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/1e42453a-e0fc-439b-ac54-d759fb2c8ab9))
- Disposition effect: Individual traders strongly prefer to sell stocks that have risen in value, and hold stocks that have fallen in value. In other words, they sell winners and hold losers. This is largely the opposite of what is prudent—the stocks that rise tend to rise even further, and likewise for falling stocks. (In turn, the reason traders do this can do with loss aversion, narrow accounting, and self-control issues. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/dbee7a6c-eb7f-42bf-b693-d2784ccbef97))
- Trading stocks is entertaining and provides emotional, visceral engagement the same way gambling does. In this way, trading can be seen to compete with other entertaining activities; when alternatives such as legal gambling and lotteries are introduced, active trading drops. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/c073d7bc-849b-424a-8760-07cc503c26c8))
- As we think about investments today, we don’t have the benefit of future information, and so it becomes important to assess whether the stock market is expensive or cheap. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/e7574e1c-4b64-4452-bd2f-f41c7faebd72))
- Long-term stock charts are often shown in log scale since they better reflect percentage changes and compounded growth ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/1a07f192-97ab-4ed3-96c7-381d9fc50008))
    - Note: What is the unit on the Y axis of this graph
- P/E ratio of 10 or below is low, and the stock is considered cheap. A P/E ratio of 20 or above is high (or the stock is expensive). ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/375708a0-3621-4930-bce8-604a6dcbc389))
- A stock’s dividend yield is the amount paid in annual dividends per share of stock, divided by its stock price. If a company pays $1 in dividends per share, and the stock price is $20, the dividend yield is 5% ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/85504506-59c4-4ef9-aedd-deeef3b26922))
- A stock’s dividend yield is the amount paid in annual dividends per share of stock, divided by its stock price. If a company pays $1 in dividends per share, and the stock price is $20, the dividend yield is 5%.
  The bond yield is the return on a bond. Simplistically, if a bond costs $1,000 and pays $100 per year, the yield is 10%. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/d19e2d02-612a-4bff-b329-3f70c325e0af))
- If the bond yield is notably higher than the stock’s dividend yield, it might indicate that stocks are overpriced. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/9d28650e-0506-4e5e-abfc-5f70d3a05e9a))
    - Note: What about for growth companies that don’t pay dividends?
- If someone says stocks will always go up, ask, “why? If everyone buys stock according to this belief, then won’t stock prices be unreasonably high? And if companies can only earn finite amounts of profit, won’t the stock price at some point exceed a reasonable value for the company?” ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/20d9dfe7-a4bc-4e89-8f56-fa200875ed63))
- he heavily cautions against simplistically extrapolating from the past, and against the delusion that stocks will always increase and so are worth investing in at any time, at any price. These conditions tend to breed wanton overpricing, which tends to invite a steep correction downward. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/72e6494c-f538-459e-b5af-5d5653f068bc))
- Stocks tend to have better returns (though this isn’t always true; if interest rates are very high, as they were in parts of the 1970s and early 80s, bonds may provide better returns). ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/d4b91fad-4cf3-42a8-95de-005be2e98853))
- You shouldn’t rebalance more frequently than once or twice a year. If you’re checking your investments on a daily basis and spending hours per week, you’re getting too involved to be a defensive investor, and your emotions will likely start ruling your decisions. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/856c92c4-7205-4f0b-abe8-3a0c46f08bbf))
- Graham advises holding at least 10 and at most 30 stocks. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/a908c586-1dec-4f1e-8fb4-cb99f106be75))
- Graham argues for a maximum per-share price of 25 times average earnings over the past 7 years, or 20 times earnings over the past 12 months. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/8febc9e3-89ec-4532-b1f5-095500c5fb38))
- say today you buy a treasury bond from the US federal government with a principal of $10,000. The term is 20 years, with a coupon rate of 4%. Every year, you will receive $400 in interest payments. In 20 years, the government will pay you back $10,000. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/4be620e2-9df4-4fae-a2bb-fc9f5fd4975b))
- Higher-yielding “junk bonds” provide a higher return with higher risk of default. Graham advises defensive investors to steer clear of these, since they require detailed study to find bargains. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/f7e285d6-5cb4-4304-a0ad-b7a32ce18f08))
- In a company’s liquidation, preferred stock has more senior rights than common stock, but lower than bonds and creditors. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/caf9ce21-ce0d-4f0d-976b-072094e6039c))
- aggressive investors should methodically value potential investments, be patient for bargains, and maintain level-headedness when the market is reactive in either direction. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/3dc845d0-96ab-4d2e-870c-8b7d109e2dbc))
- The current stock price already has all existing information “priced in,” and from this point stock market movements are essentially unpredictable. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/a4e0f4d8-d514-45d3-be50-e2ebcb617807))
- Most investors have a bad strategy. If you adopt a non-consensus strategy, you might be able to beat them. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/0858574b-22c3-4c7e-8b39-2f8597fbba5b))
- Graham’s strategy is to use a framework to value companies reliably, then identify companies that are priced lower than their fair value. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/07da3d4a-3a85-4467-b727-2dfdc36b4385))
- Despite the claims of the efficient market hypothesis, there will remain pricing inefficiencies in the market, particularly because market movements are made of people following their own flawed psychology and of such people mimicking each other. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/6a801163-5901-4b6c-ae76-0e6680e9755f))
- Enthusiasm is great for endeavors outside of investing. In investing, it will ruin you. Here you need self-control. You cannot let other people’s opinions and emotions sway your own. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/4fbf2dde-d893-419b-8bbf-75024137a272))
- An investor’s success is defined just as much by what he chooses not to do as by what he does. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/e35c5406-d712-4f74-9dc1-223f9e06d505))
- When considering IPOs, we tend to fixate on the landmark examples of the past—the Microsofts and the Apples—while forgetting that most other IPOs were bad investments. Zweig notes that, between 1980 to 2001, if you had bought each IPO and kept it for 3 years, you would have underperformed the market by 23% annually. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/8cb7700b-414f-4559-ad84-e7f5efa76280))
- Market timing has a strong allure: buy when the market is down, and sell when the market is up. The trouble is determining when exactly the bottom or the peak of a market is. This often seems obvious in retrospect but is exceedingly difficult to predict in the future. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/dcf9a593-8426-4d7e-95f7-aa053824a347))
- In the 1950s, airline traffic was poised to grow by multiples. But investing in airlines would have been a mistake—despite rising revenues, airlines were chronically unprofitable. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/35f81a02-eea2-4324-98dc-5d5ffd7a4cc7))
- In the 2000 dotcom bust, countless reputable investors forecast unlimited growth and considered traditional investing principles obsolete. Some stocks reached a price/earnings ratio of over 100! ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/9dd0c98d-e960-491f-9494-06bd56affdbb))
- history is unkind to people who concentrate so heavily. Take the 400 richest people on the Forbes list in 1982 and look 20 years later—only 64 (or 16%) remained on the list in 2002. The rest had most of their worth tied to their business and enjoyed a temporary fortune; when their businesses went south, their worth followed. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/a9d6e4f0-c35b-4b06-8e47-6f39f46c5594))
- How do you calculate the stock’s value, then? Two methods:
  Take the company’s future earnings and multiply these by a factor relevant to the company and industry. (Shortform note: a related method is discounted cash flow.)
  Estimate the value of the business to a buyer. This value might generally be similar to the future earnings method, but more attention might be paid to the value of assets. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/2fbf296f-dd40-4771-b0a7-c9956b922191))
- invest when secondary companies are out of fashion, when the market believes they are headed to extinction. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/1964fbb0-aed1-46d9-875c-af73fcd5eaf9))
- The more a stock price deviates from the company’s current book value, the more speculative the stock is, and the more volatile the price will be. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/2f0447cc-335f-48d7-b0ef-31f70a0ef68c))
- concentrate on stocks trading at no more than one-third above the company’s book value. Investments in these stocks can be justified on solid financial grounds and will be less subject to the whimsies of stock speculators. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/9d9bf2b2-83ea-43c3-b201-7b813a2f3566))
- It’s human nature to have your emotions pulled with the market.
  When you haven’t bought stock and the price rises, you fear missing out and regret not having bought earlier. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/82746352-d1e1-4850-8cd9-7ddc5a2d3819))
- If you know the fundamental value of a business, why should the mistakes of other people influence your behavior? Behaving this way is like having your emotions and behavior dictated by other people. You have no obligation to act according to market fluctuations. You should deliberately choose to transact only when it is in your favor. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/44bea11a-0906-4bfe-a8f3-3c0d48554659))
- The one advantage you have over money managers is that you do not need to follow Mr. Market. Money managers do, because they represent the interests of people (who themselves follow Mr. Market): ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/3be97f6e-7e43-4f19-8ec5-28c7a274858d))
- While most funds tend not to outperform the market, there is a small minority that do outperform over the long term. These tend to be small funds that don’t manage vast amounts of capital, suggesting that more capital causes funds to shift closer to market returns. Furthermore, these highly-performing funds tend to be closed to the public and thus out of your reach. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/d6fb31ff-028c-41bc-931c-548d76c84981))
- The chief question when buying stocks is whether the stock’s current price is too high or too low relative to its underlying value. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/591ebf43-3261-42e6-a920-e1c298f2d972))
- A stock with a higher P/E multiple implies a faster earnings growth rate than a stock with a lower multiple. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/4b2d64da-8eed-48f1-b402-52432dd01d73))
- The company doesn’t grow merely on the backs of debt. On their cash flow statement, look out for “cash from financing activities”—this is cash flow from raising money and shouldn’t be confused with real sales growth. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/fa9cffa0-07c1-45c9-92bf-59b963ae2fe4))
- Graham recommends an assets to liabilities ratio of 2:1 or better. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/5c13cbcd-9657-4e45-9f0b-d7cbff0a076c))
- On the balance sheet, long-term debt should be under 50% of total capital. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/08d191eb-2b9d-4551-9167-f9ba2ba9713a))
- Calculate “owner earnings,” or what a 100% owner would take home in cash each year. This is calculated by net income plus amortization and depreciation minus capital expenditures. Owner earnings more sensibly relates company profits than the reported net income ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/5d394295-c9ab-43e5-8756-20cd7f1efb06))
- Company Value = Current Earnings x (8.5 + 2x expected annual growth rate over next 10 years) ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/4e10349a-e431-420f-935d-bfedfb93bc81))
- Value / Earnings = 8.5 + 2x expected annual growth rate
  For example:
  A company with an expected annual growth rate of 20% could justify a P/E ratio of 48.5 (8.5 + 2*20).
  A company with an expected annual growth rate of 10% could justify a P/E ratio of 28.5. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/ab6373b6-678c-4550-8a08-1af8fdba3db0))
- Value / Earnings = 8.5 + 2x expected annual growth rate
  For example:
  A company with an expected annual growth rate of 20% could justify a P/E ratio of 48.5 (8.5 + 2*20).
  A company with an expected annual growth rate of 10% could justify a P/E ratio of 28.5.
  A company with an expected annual growth rate of 0% could justify a P/E ratio of 8.5. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/dff2e043-0006-4c73-93bb-5060c585a546))
- If, through your analysis, you find that a company’s fair value is $500 million, but its current market capitalization is lower at $400 million, the stock may be a bargain.
  Likewise, if you believe a company’s value is $500 million but its market value is $1 billion, the stock may be highly overpriced and need to achieve incredible growth to earn its valuation. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/df279e1f-16bd-4f9b-85af-1f7aed499654))
- While we’ve treated earnings to be a fairly dependable number, in practice companies may use accounting sleight of hand to make their financials look more promising. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/efb6cf2f-5057-4e23-befa-f590d3ae7f00))
- defensive investors should treat stock picking as just an entertaining intellectual pursuit and not their core investment strategy. As a defensive investor, if you really want to pick your own stocks, allocate only 10% of your stock value to individual stocks; 90% should go into an index fund. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/d4d97f83-044f-44e8-8a14-2fc39aa77e49))
- A strong company is not a good investment if its stock is overpriced.
  A stock at a low price is not a good investment if the company has poor future prospects.
  A stock with tremendous hype around growth, and high prices to match, is likely too speculative for intelligent investors. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/cdc90eef-9ab6-4c05-94bb-b4740672843e))
- stocks in speculative price ranges tend to be more volatile to bad news—the current high price already assumes most things will work out, so news that contradicts this belief shatters the current valuation. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/945664b0-c30e-4d9b-ac96-1343d6d7bc24))
- Earnings yield is the inverse of the P/E ratio: the company’s earnings per share divided by the stock price. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/ac9cbd96-cc01-4500-9a37-462ea91d483e))
- To define the margin of safety of a stock more technically, compare the earnings yield of the company with the current going bond rate.
  Earnings yield is the inverse of the P/E ratio: the company’s earnings per share divided by the stock price. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/3629e381-fc36-4509-9490-0fdebed01d9c))
- For example, if the earnings yield is 9% (implying a P/E multiple of around 11), and the bond rate is 4%, the margin is 5%.
  In contrast, at a high P/E multiple of 30, the earnings yield is 3.3%, which is below the bond rate and thus indicative of a low margin of safety. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/74a00684-f325-4a7a-b418-21aa6c58e742))
- investors define their margin of safety from simple mathematical metrics, such as price-to-earnings ratio and assets-to-liabilities. These metrics have proved their reliability over decades of investment experience and are not subject to the whims of human psychology. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/f646bd5a-2627-4f0b-be80-57b19b97c76d))
- Warren Buffett has said about value investing, “if a business is worth a dollar and I can buy it for 40 cents, something good may happen to me.” ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/48c98bea-0048-4ce3-a226-7c0e0518d19b))
