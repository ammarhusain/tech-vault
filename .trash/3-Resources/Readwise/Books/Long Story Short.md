## Highlights
- Most events in life can be categorized in one of two ways:
  a good time, or a good story. (Page 3)
- TELL YOUR STORY - Write down a list of ten quirks about yourself. (Page 13)
- As we grow older, we get comfortable in our lives, being home on the couch, watching the same television shows, taking the same route to work every day, staying at the same job for years. Think about how many of your more interesting stories take place somewhere other than your house or apartment. How many take place somewhere other than the town or city where you currently live? (Page 19)
- So be brave! Do things that scare you. Don´t cop out on life or you'll have no stories to tell. (Page 20)
- Our worst misfortunes never happen, and most miseries lie in anticipation.
  -HONORÉ DE BALZAC, novelist (Page 25)
- In storytelling, it’s all about you - make sure your story focuses on you. Storytelling isn't about bashing someone else; it's about being brave enough to share your story and make others feel better about their own lives. (Page 30)
- If you ain't desperate at some point in your life, you ain't interesting.
  -JIM CARREY (Page 37)
- Don’t be afraid to be uncool. In storytelling, your audience wants you to succeed. They are not challenging you. These people are there to hear you speak, and they cannot wait for you to some. And the more real you are about your life experience, the more they will love you. (Page 38)
- "story zone"-not so safe that it will bore us, but not so personal that you would only tell a therapist. (Page 39)
- Remember, the stories you find yourself telling repeatedly in social situations are the one you should be exploring to develop more. (Page 65)
- • Plot: What happens in your story. Think of this like a TV Guide description of your story. (Should be the same for every listener.)
  • Universal Theme: The message behind your story. (May vary by listener.)
  • Point of entry: the moment the listener applies your story to his/her own life and becomes even more engaged. (Well vary by listener) (Page 68)
- Indifference is the enemy of storytelling.
  If you don't feel strongly about what you are talking about, the audience won't care about it either. (Page 86)
- As listeners, we often care more about how you felt about what happened than what actually happened. (Page 89)
- "Motivation for the story” 
  Trick your audience into hearing your bigger message by layering it into your story. Don't beat us over the head with it. Write it at the top of your story script and let it be just for you. (Page 108)
- You can't control whether or not someone will get your point or find something funny.
  Sometimes things go over our heads. Sometimes we get it. Sometimes we don't. Sometimes we're dealing with our own issues and want to take a certain meaning from a tale that applies to our current situation. Let go of the desire to control the audience. (Page 114)
- The more efficient a force is, the more silent and the more subtle it is.
  -MAHATMA GANDHI (Page 116)
- It’s not just the events in your story that make it entertaining; it’s your reaction to the events (Page 128)
- You'll want to take your endearing traits and use them to your advantage. You might want to acknowledge anything that is obvious about you right away, so as not to distract from your story. Then move on. (Page 136)
- What makes your story a story that only you can tell is how clearly you define yourself as a character.
  Adding nostalgia is also a great way to get a laugh. (Page 147)
- The more specific you are, the more relatable you are.
  -JANEANE GAROFALO (Page 151)
- Try and find a way to nail down any other characters in a sentence or two. My friend and brilliant storyteller Brian Finkelstein once described a character in a story as a man who “was dipping a chamomile tea bag into an NPR coffee mug." That's it. But it nailed the essence of the character perfectly. (Page 154)
- We root for underdogs, plain and simple.
  Be an underdog in your story. (Page 162)
- In order to really connect with your audience, you have to put your flaws out there and incorporate them into your piece. (Page 169)
- Inner monologue shows the audience what you were thinking at the time of an event. It can turn a two-minute story into a ten-minute story. You can also use this technique when you are the star. (Page 191)
- If we know exactly where your story is headed, then why should we listen? Great stories throw us for a loop and take us somewhere we never anticipated. Adding an element of the unexpected into your tale can really make it soar. (Page 201)
- What I loved about Joel, is you never knew what direction his story was taking, and he wasn't afraid to go dark. He wasn't seeking audience approval; he was sharing his truth. (Page 204)
- A truly stable system expects the unexpected, is prepared to be disrupted, waits to be transformed.
  -TOM ROBBINS (Page 207)
- STORYTELLING GUIDELINES 1/2
  Keep it true.
  Make sure your story has a universal theme that is relatable, not self-indulgent or overly personal.
  Have multiple points of entry.
  Don't be heavy-handed with your message. Let the story speak for itself.
  If you're not “over it," don't tell it.
  Tell us what you were thinking at the time of your story. Reveal your inner monologue, from A to Z.
  Cut the fat when introducing external characters. Use composite characters and nickname them when you can.
  Make sure we root for you. Be an underdog.
  Show us your flaws and use them to your advantage when telling your story.
  If there are full-circle connections within your story, be sure to use them. But don't force a connection.
  Be the star of your story. (Page 234)
- STORYTELLING GUIDELINES 2/2
  Add nostalgia.
  Keep us on our toes by incorporating the unexpected.
  Keep it conversational, not presentational. Cut out anything you wouldn't say to a group of your friends. You want your story to sound natural.
  Make sure you aren't just listing things, going on a rant, or making a political speech. Make sure you get to the "meat" of the story.
  If you care, we care. Passion will take you far. Emotionally respond to the tale you are recounting, but don't yell at us! (Page 235)
- Steps to prepare:
  1. Write draft of your story word for word.
  2. Ask a friend or two for notes.
  3. Revise.
  4. Identify the universal theme and write it on top. Never say it out loud.
  5. Break up the story into memorizable chunks.
  6. Underline the product words.
  7. Write notes in the margins of things to remember.
  8. Narrow those things down further into a beat sheet.
  9. Familiarize yourself with the beat sheet.
  10. Hit the stage! (Page 246)
- A personal story can get the audience on your side before you launch into the meat of your presentation. (Page 267)
- In 2007, when unveiling the iPhone at Macworld, Jobs gave a brief intro about previous Apple products that helped shape the world. This served as the beginning of his story. Note that he did not launch into how he was forced to drop out.of college for financial reasons or how he started the company-instead, he kept his intro to Apple's achievements. A lot of first-time storytellers provide too much unnecessary information up top.
- When you're telling a story, if we don't know what you want -we end up disinterested and not rooting for you.
  So be like Steve Jobs-tell us what you want! It can even be a silly or seemingly inconsequential desire, like "I just wanted to eat the corner piece of the cake with the fondant flower on it.“
- Storytelling is not stand-up comedy. You might get laughs in your story, sure, but you shouldn't force these laughs by sneaking in set-up/punch-line style jokes. If you do that, you'll risk sounding insincere.
