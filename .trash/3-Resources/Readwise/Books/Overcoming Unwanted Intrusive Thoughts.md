## Highlights
- There is nothing wrong with you, just the way you are dealing with your thoughts. ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=131))
- This book provides a unique, practical, working program to lead you to a life that is free from the dread, demoralization, and suffering that these thoughts now bring. ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=144))
- The answer is learning an entirely new relationship to thoughts, which is being neither scared nor ashamed of them. Gradually, you will learn to tame those bullies in your head and live a life that is free from their torment. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=172))
- Because you worry about it, reject it, and try to push it out of your mind, it pushes back and becomes a recurring thought or image. After a while, it starts to redirect your attention: It starts arriving with a “whoosh,” and feels awful, disgusting, or dreaded. It contains an urgent feeling of needing to get rid of it. The content of many unwanted intrusive thoughts is aggressive, sexual, taboo, anxiety-provoking, or self-derogatory. ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=201))
- it feels impossibly stuck in your head. Your efforts to deal with it become all-encompassing and take up so much time, mental energy, and focus that your quality of life is degraded. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=205))
- we introduce you to the voices that we call “Worried Voice,” “False Comfort,” and “Wise Mind.” ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=216))
- Observing and letting go of your commentary will go a long way toward gaining some relief from your intrusive thoughts. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=258))
- Thoughts stick because of the energy you expend to fight them. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=296))
- Unwanted intrusive thoughts get stuck because you inadvertently fuel them by trying to push them away. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=307))
- People who are impulsive act first and think later. People with unwanted intrusive thoughts are over-thinkers. ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=318))
- Any situation that is uncertain and has “high stakes” is a perfect place for stickiness of the mind to increase. As soon as it seems important to know something 100 percent for sure, that is where the unwanted intrusive thoughts will find their opening. ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=343))
- Sensitization can be compared to an allergy. An allergic person has a strong reaction to substances that cause little response in others. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=396))
- doesn’t seem to any reason ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=552))

- Toxic worry, on the other hand, involves trying to solve an issue where the outcome is uncertain or unknowable and there is no good answer to form an action plan. So you start to “solve” the problem once and can’t seem to come up with any good answer. So the worry returns, and then the entire process continues to repeat. ([Location 660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=660))
- What defines toxic worry is not what the worrying is about, but how the worries behave—they get stuck, repeat, escalate, and preoccupy. ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=665))
- They are not indications of character or impulses to be resisted: they are your rich imagination at work. No one is free of not entirely unwanted intrusive thoughts. It is only the struggle against them that is problematic ([Location 730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=730))
- Most of your distress is caused not by what you think or feel, but how you feel about and react to what you think or feel. ([Location 781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=781))
- Myth 1: Our Thoughts Are Under Our Control Many people falsely believe that our thoughts are under our conscious control, and so we should be able to control our thoughts. ([Location 802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=802))
- Myth 2: Our Thoughts Indicate Our Character Another thought myth is that thoughts speak to our character or underlying intentions and that some people have an underlying dark side that is revealed only in their thoughts. ([Location 825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=825))
- Thoughts are what pass through your mind. When thoughts just happen, it is not your choice. There is no place for issues of character when there is no chance for choice. A thought is not a fact or a statement about yourself. Character is about the choices you make in life, not what pops into your mind. ([Location 829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=829))
- Myth 3: Our Thoughts Indicate the Inner Self This is the belief that thoughts are paths to our inner self, sort of like eyes being windows to the soul. ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=852))
- But there is no truth to the ideas that blips of intrusive thoughts and images reveal underlying truths and that thoughts reveal motives, feelings, and intentions that are deeply meaningful or contain messages that need to be addressed when they differ from conscious thoughts, feeling, and intentions. ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=866))
- Myth 4: The Unconscious Mind Can Affect Actions This is the belief that our unconscious mind is a powerful force that directs our thoughts and behaviors, sometimes operating in the dark and against our conscious minds and will. ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=869))
- But it is simply not true that feared thoughts are fueled by underlying wishes or are warnings that should be heeded. ([Location 887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=887))
- Myth 5: Thinking Something Makes It Likely to Happen ([Location 891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=891))
- Many people don’t like the idea of negative thoughts because they believe that having negative thoughts means that more negative things will happen. Some people believe that negative attracts negative and that positive attracts positive. ([Location 893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=893))
- Myth 6: Thinking Something Makes It Unlikely to Happen ([Location 913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=913))
- Feeling that you need to stay engaged by constantly thinking about someone is falling for the false alarms of anxiety. ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=920))
- Myth 7: Only Sick People Have Intrusive Thoughts ([Location 921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=921))
- The stickiness has a lot to do with how you think and feel about these thoughts and the methods and intensity you are using to try to rid yourself of them. ([Location 929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=929))
- Myth 8: Every Thought Is Worth Thinking ([Location 932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=932))
- Myth 9: Thoughts That Repeat Are Important You may believe that thoughts that repeat must be important. After all, it would seem, if a thought were not important, it would just fly out of our mind and be forgotten. The fact that the thought keeps recurring must mean that it is significant. ([Location 963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=963))
- thoughts tend to repeat if they are resisted or pushed away. So if you have a repeating thought that you are resisting, that same thought will start to fade away when you stop trying to resist it. ([Location 967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=967))
- When we invest energy in any thought, it builds up the neural connections and makes the thought more likely to happen ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=971))
- Even though unwanted intrusive thoughts are signs of overcontrol and not impulsivity, you may actually feel that you have to put a lot of effort to keep yourself from acting on the thoughts. This is an illusion. ([Location 1015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1015))
- anxious thinking, which is an altered state of awareness. Once your brain sends out an anxiety alarm signal, your perception of many things becomes markedly different. ([Location 1017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1017))
- fighting the thoughts is a major reason why they become stuck and cause so much psychological misery in the first place. Remember, you try to block the thoughts because their message feels so unacceptable. And as you continue to fight, they become more persistent and more anxiety-arousing. ([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1048))
- People with OCD experience obsessions, which are thoughts that arrive with a whoosh of emotion, feel dangerous or unacceptable, cause considerable distress, and are accompanied by a strong need to be neutralized or banished. ([Location 1067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1067))
- The compulsions in OCD may be obvious behavioral rituals that feel driven—like washing, checking, ordering, and counting. But there are also compulsions that are entirely in the mind and consist of giving oneself repeated reassurances or ways to discount, undo, or avoid the obsessive thoughts. People with OCD give their thoughts more power than they deserve. If you have OCD, you probably have the tendency to feel very uncomfortable with uncertainty. ([Location 1069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1069))
- When fearful pathways are triggered frequently, they become automatic. (Neurologists like to say, “Nerves that fire together, wire together.”) ([Location 1169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1169))
- If a thought is followed by an anxious experience, the pathway from thought to fear gets established. When this happens repeatedly, your brain becomes conditioned to react anxiously and automatically to that thought. This sets up the conditions for unwanted intrusive thoughts to take hold. ([Location 1172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1172))
- Getting over unwanted intrusive thoughts involves creating new pathways that are not fearful. ([Location 1176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1176))
- Because it is designed to alert you to danger, your amygdala is triggered by just the merest hint of a possible danger. Its job is to protect you—not to keep you comfortable—so it would rather set off a thousand false alarms and create a thousand whooshes of fear when there is no problem at all than miss one that is real. ([Location 1185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1185))
- Even emotional reactions like feeling trapped, anticipating rejection, or having doubts can set off alarms. In other words, your amygdala will set off a whoosh of fear in response to triggers that constitute no real danger. ([Location 1203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1203))
- In cases like these—where the trigger is not a real danger, but rather an unsettling reminder of past unwanted thoughts, an ambiguous expression on someone’s face that could possibly indicate rejection, or the thought of hurting a baby you love—this emergency mode is the opposite of helpful. In fact, it makes you wonder whether your mind is working properly. This state of mind is called anxious thinking. ([Location 1305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1305))
- Even though thoughts are triggering fears, people feel as if they are living through—not just thinking about—a dangerous experience. Thought-action fusion makes it seem that there is little difference between thinking about something and it actually happening. ([Location 1314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1314))
- Anxious thinking requires an absolute guarantee that a disastrous experience you might think about won’t occur. You feel driven to ask for reassurances of safety, and you try to avoid the situations that trigger the feeling. And, of course, anxious thinking can’t get that guarantee. ([Location 1323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1323))
- Effort used to not think of a thought actually makes it more intrusive. ([Location 1329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1329))
- anxious thinking makes thoughts feel threatening. ([Location 1332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1332))
- Your brain makes you sensitized and reactive to certain thoughts by altering the way your thoughts feel, and this begins the process. ([Location 1335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1335))
- A mind is stickier as soon as you start worrying about stickiness or checking on it to see if it is sticky. Stickiness can feel uncomfortable, but it is not dangerous or meaningful. ([Location 1360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1360))
- the harder you try to not think them, the louder and more insistent they become. Effort seems to work backward. ([Location 1370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1370))
- there are, however, many important times in everyone’s lives where less is more. And putting less direct effort into accomplishing a goal actually makes success more likely! This is paradoxical effort at work. ([Location 1389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1389))
- Sometimes you just have to figure out how to let time pass. ([Location 1397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1397))
- Maximum learning requires an open, passive, curious attitude of attention. Judging yourself harshly while you are learning is not only unpleasant, it works against you. ([Location 1400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1400))
- Entanglement with a thought means that you have created an inner dialogue about the aggressive, sexual, nonsensical, or otherwise bewildering content running through your mind. You are judging it, arguing with it, or trying to reassure yourself about it. Or, you are trying to figure out some way to become less annoyed or less irritated by the intrusive nature of certain sounds, bodily feelings, or other intrusions. You become focused on the thought or sensation and your attempts to rationalize it, explain and understand its meaning, or just put it out of your mind. Entanglement can happen in a variety of ways, but most often, answering back or arguing with an intrusion is what keeps it going. Getting involved and entangled with unwanted intrusive thoughts makes them stronger and more insistent. ([Location 1406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LWA5RQU&location=1406))
