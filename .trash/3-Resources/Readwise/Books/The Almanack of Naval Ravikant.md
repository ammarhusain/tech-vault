## Highlights
- Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do it. It is much more about understanding than purely hard work. ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=202))
##### How to Get Rich (Without Getting Lucky):
- Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=213))
- Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games. ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=217))

- You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom. ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=218))
    - Tags: #readwise/pink 
- You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=220))
    - Tags: #readwise/pink 
- Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=225))
    - Tags: #readwise/pink 
- Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable. ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=230))
    - Tags: #readwise/pink 
- Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage. ↓ Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=231))

- Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media). ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=243))
    - Tags: #readwise/pink 
- Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=249))
    - Tags: #readwise/pink 
- Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=260))
- Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true. ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=268))
    - Tags: #readwise/pink 
- Money is how we transfer wealth. Money is social credits. It is the ability to have credits and debits of other people’s time. ... Wealth is the thing you want. Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep. Wealth is the factory, the robots, cranking out things. Wealth is the computer program that’s running at night, serving other customers. Wealth is even money in the bank that is being reinvested into other assets, and into other businesses. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=282))
- Technology democratizes consumption but consolidates production. The best person in the world at anything gets to do it for everyone. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=290))

- The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed. They are creative expressions of continuous learners in free markets. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=357))
    - Tags: #readwise/pink 
- It’s much more important today to be able to become an expert in a brand-new field in nine to twelve months than to have studied the “right” thing a long time ago. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=362))

- Clear accountability is important. Without accountability, you don’t have incentives. Without accountability, you can’t build credibility. But you take risks. You risk failure. You risk humiliation. You risk failure under your own name. ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=416))

- The less you want something, the less you’re thinking about it, the less you’re obsessing over it, the more you’re going to do it in a natural way. The more you’re going to do it for yourself. You’re going to do it in a way you’re good at, and you’re going to stick with it. The people around you will see the quality of your work is higher. [1] ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=467))
    - Tags: #readwise/pink 
- You want to know how to do something other people don’t know how to do at the time period when those skills are in demand. [1] ... You get rewarded by society for giving it what it wants and doesn’t know how to get elsewhere. ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=473))
- When you do just the actual work itself, you’ll be far more productive, far more efficient. You’ll work when you feel like it—when you’re high-energy—and you won’t be trying to struggle through when you’re low energy. You’ll gain your time back. Forty hour work weeks are a relic of the Industrial Age. Knowledge workers function like athletes—train and sprint, then rest and reassess. ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=532))

- Earn with your mind, not your time. ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=555))
    - Tags: #readwise/pink 
- Value your time at an hourly rate, and ruthlessly spend to save time at that rate. You will never be worth more than you think you’re worth. ([Location 625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=625))
    - Tags: #readwise/pink 
- Status games are always going to exist. There’s no way around it, but realize most of the time, when you’re trying to create wealth and you’re getting attacked by someone else, they’re trying to increase their own status at your expense. They’re playing a different game. And it’s a worse game. It’s a zero-sum game instead of a positive-sum game. [78] ([Location 671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=671))

- What is your definition of retirement? Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you’re retired. ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=716))

- Your real résumé is just a catalog of all your suffering. If I ask you to describe your real life to yourself, and you look back from your deathbed at the interesting things you’ve done, it’s all going to be around the sacrifices you made, the hard things you did. ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=844))

- You don’t get rich by spending your time to save money. You get rich by saving your time to make money. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=871))

- The “monkey mind” will always respond with this regurgitated emotional response to what it thinks the world should be. Those desires will cloud your reality. ([Location 896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=896))

- “Tension is who you think you should be. Relaxation is who you are.” —Buddhist saying ([Location 933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=933))
    - Tags: #readwise/pink 
- If you have a criticism of someone, then don’t criticize the person—criticize the general approach or criticize the class of activities. If you have to praise somebody, then always try and find the person who is the best example of what you’re praising and praise the person, specifically. Then people’s egos and identities, which we all have, don’t work against you. They work for you. [4] ([Location 969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=969))

- The number of books completed is a vanity metric. As you know more, you leave more books unfinished. Focus on new concepts with predictive power. ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1113))
    - Tags: #readwise/pink 
- What practices do you follow to internalize/organize information from reading books? Explain what you learned to someone else. Teaching forces learning. ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1120))
    - Tags: #readwise/pink 
- We constantly walk around thinking, “I need this,” or “I need that,” trapped in the web of desires. Happiness is the state when nothing is missing. When nothing is missing, your mind shuts down and stops running into the past or future to regret something or to plan something. ([Location 1202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1202))
    - Tags: #readwise/pink 
- I’ve also come to believe in the complete and utter insignificance of the self, ... if you view yourself as a bacteria or an amoeba—or if you view all of your works as writing on water or building castles in the sand, then you have no expectation for how life should “actually” be. Life is just the way it is. When you accept that, you have no cause to be happy or unhappy. ... We think of ourselves as fixed and the world as malleable, but it’s really we who are malleable and the world is largely fixed. ([Location 1227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1227))
- I have lowered my identity. I have lowered the chattering of my mind. I don’t care about things that don’t really matter. I don’t get involved in politics. I don’t hang around unhappy people. I really value my time on this earth. I read philosophy. I meditate. I hang around with happy people. And it works. ([Location 1249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1249))
    - Tags: #readwise/pink 
- I think the most common mistake for humanity is believing you’re going to be made happy because of some external circumstance. ... The fundamental delusion: There is something out there that will make me happy and fulfilled forever. Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want. ([Location 1291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1291))
- The problem with getting good at a game, especially one with big rewards, is you continue playing it long after you should have outgrown it. Survival and replication drive put us on the work treadmill. Hedonic adaptation keeps us there. The trick is knowing when to jump off and play instead. ([Location 1329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1329))

- The reality is life is a single-player game. You’re born alone. You’re going to die alone. All of your interpretations are alone. All your memories are alone. You’re gone in three generations, and nobody cares. Before you showed up, nobody cared. It’s all single player. ([Location 1368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1368))

- When we get something, we assume the world owes it to us. If you’re present, you’ll realize how many gifts and how much abundance there is around us at all times. That’s all you really need to do. I’m here now, and I have all these incredible things at my disposal. [8] ([Location 1426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1426))

- Increase serotonin in the brain without drugs: Sunlight, exercise, positive thinking, and tryptophan. [11] ([Location 1456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1456))

- You always have three options: you can change it, you can accept it, or you can leave it. What is not a good option is to sit around wishing you would change it but not changing it, wishing you could leave it but not leaving it and not accepting it. ([Location 1470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1470))
- Your life is a firefly blink in a night. You’re here for such a brief period of time. If you fully acknowledge the futility of what you’re doing, then I think it can bring great happiness and peace because you realize this is a game. But it’s a fun game. ([Location 1498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1498))
- A lot of what goes on today is what many of you are doing right now—beating yourself up and scribbling notes and saying, “I need to do this, and I need to do that, and I need to do…” No, you don’t need to do anything. ([Location 1515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1515))
- To make an original contribution, you have to be irrationally obsessed with something. ([Location 1528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1528))
- Too much sugar leads to a heavy body, and too many distractions lead to a heavy mind. Time spent undistracted and alone, in self-examination, journaling, meditation, resolves the unresolved and takes us from mentally fat to fit. ([Location 1632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1632))
- You could also do transcendental meditation, which is where you’re using repetitive chanting to create a white noise in your head to bury your thoughts. Or, you can just very keenly and very alertly be aware of your thoughts as they happen. As you watch your thoughts, you realize how many of them are fear-based. The moment you recognize a fear, without even trying it goes away. After a while, your mind quiets. ([Location 1646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1646))
- What happens in meditation is you’re sitting there and not resisting your mind. These things will start bubbling up. It’s like a giant inbox of unanswered emails, going back to your childhood. They will come out one by one, and you will be forced to deal with them. ([Location 1662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1662))
- I’m not going to be the most successful person on the planet, nor do I want to be. I just want to be the most successful version of myself while working the least hard possible. ([Location 1793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1793))
- Freedom from Employment People who live far below their means enjoy a freedom that people busy upgrading their lifestyles can’t fathom. [11] ([Location 1870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1870))
- To me, the mind should be a servant and a tool, not a master. My monkey mind should not control and drive me 24/7. ([Location 1882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1882))
- I like the Buddhist saying, “Anger is a hot coal you hold in your hand while waiting to throw it at somebody.” ([Location 1943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1943))
