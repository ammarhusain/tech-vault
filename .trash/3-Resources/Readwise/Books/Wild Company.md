## Highlights
- A union shop - every reporter hired was required to join and pay dues - the prevailing mentality in the city room favored seniority over initiative. Plum assignments went to tired oldtimers who hacked out stories between swills of Jack Daniel's at Hanno's (Page 2)
- We were interested in money only so it could buy us the freedom to paint, write, and travel. We didn't spend much. Our entertainments were hiking, biking, reading, and home-cooked meals with friends. (Page 4)
- Starting a company wasn't so easy. Neither of us had any experience in business or had taken even a single business course in college. We knew nothing about retail, nothing about mail order, nothing about manufacturing, nothing about surplus, nothing about finance, nothing about management. The only asset we had was our own oblivion. That would keep us blissfully ignorant of the bewildering and arbitrary impediments that would entangle us until we became so embroiled that quitting was no longer a possibility (Page 9)
- We had a problem.
  A Chronicle paycheck flashed in my mind for a second, though I knew I could never go crawling back there. (Page 15)
- Through all these peregrinations, paramount to each of us was creating the free-spirited life we wanted to live. It was a future in which Patricia saw herself painting and I saw myself writing. We never saw ourselves in business - and that oddly enough includes even when we were in business. An artist and a writer on an adventure in the wilds of business, and that was it. (Page 100)
- After four months with Gap people crawling all over the place doing "due diligence" while I was fielding Don's almost daily additions of new clauses to the contract (no doubt with Ted's resourceful suggestions), each more clever than the last, the company was depleted of cash and energy. (Page 103)
- She wanted to do it. I didn't know. By a vote of one yes and one maybe, The Gap acquired Banana Republic Inc. on February 1, 1983. (Page 104)
- Managing didn't come easily to me, probably because I had the youthful conceit thinking myself unmanageable. Bluntness, little regard for consistency, and bursts of compulsiveness are not usually what define an exemplary manager. At least I saw my shortcomings and was conscious enough to exercise spotty restraint in better moments of self-awareness. (Page 134)
- It wasn't the food that changed us, or the shopping, or the postcard sights. Rather it was the way that Rio got under our skins, made us move to a new rhythm, come home with fresh eyes. John Steinbeck wrote, "We don't take a trip, a trip takes us." And once it changes us, it changes us forever. For immersion travelers, our quintessential customers, travel is the experience of losing yourself in a new place. The person who departs is never the person who returns. (Page 146)
- So goes corporate life.
  One day you're in, the next day.... (Page 191)
- We hope our story will suggest to restless creative people everywhere that creation begins with creating the life you would like to live, without fear or inhibition. It's never a straight or smooth road, but in our experience it was the bumps and the breakdowns, the mishaps and the wrong turns, that stimulated the breakthroughs we needed to get where we wanted to go.
