## Highlights
- Carmack was of the moment. His ruling force was focus. Time existed for him not in some promising future or sentimental past but in the present condition, the intricate web of problems and solutions, imagination and code.

- He approached the dilemma as he had in Keen: try the obvious approach first; if that fails, think outside the box. ([Location 1442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFNL0&location=1442))
- The other guys didn’t think Jason was quite motivated enough; he had once commented how he made more money from his investments than from his computer programming. ([Location 1513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFNL0&location=1513))
