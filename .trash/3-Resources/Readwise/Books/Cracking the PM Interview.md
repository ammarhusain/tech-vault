Full Title: Cracking the PM Interview

Date Highlighted: [[2021-08-25-Wednesday]]

## Highlights
- PM takes holistic responsibility for the product, from the little details to the big picture. The PM needs to set vision and strategy. The PM defines success and makes decisions. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=221))
- One reason product management is such an appealing career is you get to sit at the intersection of technology, business, and design. You get to wear many hats and learn multiple points of view. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=227))
- The day-to-day work of a product manager varies over the course of the product life cycle. At the beginning, you’ll be figuring out what to build; in the middle you’ll help the team make progress; at the end you’ll be preparing for the launch. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=236))
- Microsoft has many PMs, with the ratio in some teams as high as 1:3. At other companies, a ratio of 1:10 is more common. Google and Twitter are known for having very few PMs per engineer. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=486))
- Google’s vision comes from the bottom up, and teams are often engineering driven. Product managers focus on strategy, analysis, and facilitation of the engineering team. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=526))

- With all of this emphasis on technical experience, engineers are in a great place to break into product management. ([Location 978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=978))
- Engineers and developers can usually pick up most of the other important skills on the job, but a customer focus is one of the defining characteristics of good PMs. This means not just thinking of cool ideas, but relentlessly thinking about the target audience, their hopes and dreams, their needs, and how they’re different from you and the other people at your company. ([Location 982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=982))
- As you’re preparing for the product manager role, practice describing features from the customer’s point of view by calling out the user-facing benefits. It’s important to talk more like a PM than an engineer if you want to be considered seriously for the role. ([Location 996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=996))
- Visionary or strategic thinking is another area to focus on when transitioning to product management. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=998))
- For most of your career, you’ve needed to lower other people’s unrealistic expectations. As a product manager, you need to let go of that instinct and allow yourself to envision a world where you’ve made the impossible happen. ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=999))
- It might sound crazy, but for any product or feature you’re working on, think about how it could change the world. ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=1004))
- See if you can tie the benefits to fundamental human needs like safety, friendship, or self-esteem. Start your brainstorming with the phrase “If I had a magic wand...” ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=1005))
- Allow yourself to dream. ([Location 1011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=1011))
- you’ll be responsible for a lot of decisions, you’ll spend more time in meetings. ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=1026))
- The work is less tangible In engineering, you get the satisfaction of writing code and seeing it work. As a PM, most of your work doesn’t have such concrete output. ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=1030))
- If you have trouble getting to “Inbox Zero” (no messages in your inbox), try learning a time management system like Getting Things Done. A few small changes to your routine can sometimes make a big difference in how organized you are. ([Location 1216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=1216))
- Infrastructure teams often don’t sound like a fun place to be a PM, but they’re critically important to the company. The improvements you make as an infrastructure PM can be magnified throughout the company, so they can be a great place for career advancement. ([Location 1233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=1233))
- Take on cross-team or company-wide tasks. ([Location 1235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=1235))
- Define and measure success. ([Location 1243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=1243))
- Don’t just do what’s asked of you. Get the job done. ([Location 1253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=1253))
- This was where I learned that whoever writes things down has the power. People in different disciplines such as test and dev think that PMs make all the decisions. Then when they switch over and they wonder how they got to make decisions, and it’s because whoever writes things down records history. The ways you write things down and what you write down define history. The power of the pen. ([Location 1418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=1418))
- The thing I tell everyone is that a PM is an expert in their customer. That’s what sets them apart from the developers and testers. ([Location 1441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=1441))
- As another interviewing tip, when I’m interviewing and I want to tell if the person should be a dev or a PM, I’ll usually ask questions that can go in two different directions. You can either start designing the solution and building algorithms, or you can step back and talk about who the customers are, what the goals are, and start defining success. ([Location 1453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=1453))
- Communicate what you are doing. In a big company you really need people above you who will allocate resources and get conflicting projects to be on your side, so messaging what you are achieving becomes important. ([Location 1545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=1545))
- people people ([Location 1557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=1557))

    - Note: - Duplicate
- That said, all great PMs are goal oriented. They’re able to get things done, focus, prioritize. One mistake junior PMs at Google (and probably at other other big companies too) make is to go to too many meetings and think their work is done. A good PM defines what it takes to achieve her goals. ([Location 1557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=1557))
- You need to genuinely like being around people and working with people, bringing their best energy forward. You need to be the type of person who thrives on being in the thick of it, solving problems on the fly, and making decisions quickly without fear. You can’t be the quiet person in the corner who wants to be left alone all day. ([Location 1613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=1613))
- You should be prepared with a solid pitch about your background, accomplishments, and interests. ([Location 2623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=2623))
- Why you are a good PM: Have you shown initiative in your current job? Do you have deep technical skills? ([Location 2711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=2711))

- Type 1: Designing a Product These questions aren’t nearly as open-ended as they sound. You want to approach these questions like a good PM would: with a structured approach that starts with the user. Remember: it’s not about what you want the product to be. It’s about what the user wants. ([Location 4008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ISYMUR6&location=4008))
