## Highlights
- This urge to reduce the poor to a set of clichés has been with us for as long as there has been poverty: The poor appear, in social theory as much as in literature, by turns lazy or enterprising, noble or thievish, angry or passive, helpless or self-sufficient. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=183))
- All too often, the economics of poverty gets mistaken for poor economics: Because the poor possess very little, it is assumed that there is nothing interesting about their economic existence. ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=190))
- It is not easy to escape from poverty, but a sense of possibility and a little bit of well-targeted help (a piece of information, a little nudge) can sometimes have surprisingly large effects. On the other hand, misplaced expectations, the lack of faith where it is needed, and seemingly minor hurdles can be devastating. A push on the right lever can make a huge difference, but it is often difficult to know where that lever is. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=226))
- In his best-selling 2005 book, The End of Poverty,4 Sachs argues that if the rich world had committed $195 billion in foreign aid per year between 2005 and 2025, poverty could have been entirely eliminated by the end of this period. ... William Easterly, who battles Sachs from New York University at the other end of Manhattan, has become one of the most influential anti-aid public figures, ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=286))
- in The Life You Can Save, Singer takes the trouble to offer his readers a list of concrete examples of things that they should support, regularly updated on his Web site.12 Kristof and WuDunn do the same. ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=339))
- The lack of a grand universal answer might sound vaguely disappointing, but in fact it is exactly what a policy maker should want to know—not that there are a million ways that the poor are trapped but that there are a few key factors that create the trap, and that alleviating those particular problems could set them free and point them toward a virtuous cycle of increasing wealth and investment. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=453))
- As we will see, ideology, ignorance, and inertia—the three I’s—on the part of the expert, the aid worker, or the local policy maker, often explain why policies fail and why aid does not have the effect it should. It is possible to make the world a better place—probably not tomorrow, but in some future that is within our reach—but we cannot get there with lazy thinking.

- In terms of calories per rupee, the millets (jowar and bajra) were clearly the best buy.Yet only about two-thirds of the total spending on grains was on these grains, while another 30 percent was spent on rice and wheat, which cost on average about twice as much per calorie. ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=584))
- If the consumption of the staple is associated with being poor (say, because it is cheap but not particularly tasty), feeling richer might actually have made them consume less of it. Once again, this suggests that at least among these very poor urban households, getting more calories was not a priority: Getting better-tasting ones was.8 ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=594))
- One study finds that potatoes may have been responsible for 12 percent of the global increase in population between 1700 and 1900.11 ([Location 620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=620))
- Instead of raging against their destiny, they have made things tolerable by reducing their standards. But they don’t necessarily reduce their standards by cutting out luxuries and concentrating on necessities; more often it is the other way around—the more natural way, if you come to think of it—hence the fact that in a decade of unparalleled depression, the consumption of all cheap luxuries has increased. ([Location 834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=834))
- problem may be less the quantity of food than its quality, and in particular the shortage of micronutrients. The benefits of good nutrition may be particularly strong for two sets of people who do not decide what they eat: unborn babies and young children. ([Location 856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=856))
- There are even cheaper ways to avert diarrhea, such as adding chlorine to water. Other very inexpensive medical or public health technologies with proven effectiveness include ORS, getting children immunized, deworming drugs, exclusive breast-feeding until six months, and some routine antenatal procedures such as a tetanus shot for the expectant mother. Vitamin B against night blindness, iron pills and iron-fortified flour against anemia, and so on are other examples of low-hanging fruit.

- Across the developing world, we are seeing a rise in antibiotic resistance. Similarly, incorrect dosage and poor patient compliance explain the emergence, in several African countries, of strains of malaria parasites that are resistant to mainstream medications, which has the makings of a public health disaster. ([Location 1102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=1102))
- Private facilities offer the assurance that the doctor will be there. If he isn’t, he won’t get paid, whereas the absent government employee on a salary will. ([Location 1122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=1122))
- The low immunization rates, it was widely held, must have been the result of the delinquency of the nurses. Mothers would just get tired of walking all the way there with a young child and not finding the nurse. ([Location 1146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=1146))
- In fact, there is a “psychological sunk cost” effect—people are more likely to make use of something they have paid a lot for. In addition, people may judge quality by price: Things may be judged to be valueless precisely because they are cheap. ([Location 1161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=1161))
- Several studies that have tested whether people use things less because they got them for free found no evidence of such behavior. ([Location 1172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=1172))
- In the end, the mistrust of incentives for immunization comes down to an article of faith for both those on the right and the left of the mainstream political spectrum: Don’t try to bribe people to do things that you think they ought to do. For the right, this is because it will be wasted; for the conventional left, which includes much of the public health community and the good doctor from Seva Mandir, this is because it degrades both what is given and the person who gets it. Instead, we should focus on trying to convince the poor of the benefits of immunization. ([Location 1274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007CI81IQ&location=1274))
- An important idea is that of default option: The government (or a well-meaning NGO) should make the option that it thinks is the best for most people the default choice, so that people will need to actively move away from it if they want to. So people have the right to choose what they want, but there is a small cost of doing so, and as a result, most people end up choosing the default option.
