## Highlights
- Ethereum isn’t only a network for its digital currency, ether. It’s meant to be the base layer for developers to build whatever application they can dream of, including issuing their own coin. All they had to do was push out a few lines of code and they could mint cryptocurrency and trade it for bitcoin or ether, which could then be exchanged for dollars—the so-called ICO funding mechanism that demolished the barriers between those seeking to raise money and those willing to give it away for the chance of getting rich.

- “cypher” (a way to encrypt information) and “cyberpunk” (a science fiction subgenre that depicts high-tech worlds where society has broken down) to christen the emerging group as the “cypherpunks.” For cypherpunks, cryptography would be a tool to effect wider social and political change. Some of them even advocated for crypto-anarchy, a belief that cryptography would enable a world free from corporate or state control.

- Then in 2001, BitTorrent was released, doing to movies and larger files what Napster had done with music. They arguably brought peer-to-peer (P2P) applications into the mainstream. Peer-to-peer networks interconnect equally privileged nodes with each other, allowing users to share and transfer data without the need of a centralized administrative entity.

- In the 1980s and 1990s there were key problems cypherpunks were trying to solve before they could get there. One is that digital coins, unlike cash, are just computer code that can easily be replicated and falsified. The problem, known as “double spend,” can be solved using a centralized entity that keeps a record on the coins and authenticates them, but the challenge was to transfer value without having to trust a third party. Another issue to address in peer-to-peer, pseudonymous systems was Sybil attacks. Just as coins can be replicated in a digital world, so can identities. This is a problem in a network of equal peers because an attacker could create a large number of pseudonymous identities to gain a disproportionately large influence.

- He said he proposed solving the double-spend problem by using a “peer-to-peer network which timestamps transactions by linking them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work.” ([Location 689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X8HS2WC&location=689))

    - Note: This is analogous to git commits
- cryptographic hash function, which works like a magic scrambling machine where an input of any length spits out a group of letters and numbers of a fixed length. The computers, or nodes, use all the most recent, unconfirmed transactions as inputs in the hash function and try to combine them with arbitrary data in such a way that the result starts with a certain, specific number of zeros. This is very intense computing work and takes a lot of energy to do, but once one of the computers gets the answer, it’s easy for the rest to check.

- Vitalik had written in the BitcoinTalk forum that “government is bad because it’s a monopoly more than for any other reason. You can think of the world as a free market anarchy where all the land is legitimately owned by 193 landowners that allow you to live on the land under certain conditions.” ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X8HS2WC&location=988))

- J.R. wrote in the “Second Bitcoin Whitepaper” that Mastercoin would be a protocol layer between the existing Bitcoin blockchain and the users’ currencies, and the software would “contain simple tools which will allow anyone to design and release their own currency, with their own rules without doing any software development.” Fundraising was just one of many potential uses for these new cryptocurrencies issued on top of the Bitcoin network. The Mastercoin software would allow users to create so-called smart contracts within the Bitcoin ecosystem. ([Location 1076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X8HS2WC&location=1076))

- Why couldn’t they get that what he was saying is so much better, Vitalik thought. He considered working on a specific feature maybe for half a second but immediately discarded the idea. That approach was just wrong. The more he looked at these Bitcoin 2.0 projects, the more they felt like a Swiss Army knife. All these people spending so much time making the nail file, the corkscrew, the tiny scissors . . . but what if nobody wants to use any of those things right now, and they just want a knife, or something else entirely different? Why not build the Lego blocks that would allow anyone to make whatever they want? ([Location 1159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X8HS2WC&location=1159))

- By early December it became clear there was enough interest to make Ethereum its own separate blockchain, instead of an overlay of Primecoin. Vitalik’s vision was much too big to be constrained by another chain. He was thinking about creating a base layer for everything. A computer that could simultaneously live in all the nodes of an enormous global network, which would be able to process anything you threw at it, without downtime or interference, so developers could build whatever they dreamed of, and nobody would be able to stop them or their applications. Like an infinite machine. ([Location 1313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X8HS2WC&location=1313))

- Ethereum uses the Account/Balance model, which keeps track of the total balance, or “state,” of each account. If Bitcoin’s UTXO model is similar to bills and coins, Ethereum’s model is more like a checking account, allowing for fine-grained control over the amount that can be withdrawn, and making more complex programs easier to implement.

- In Ethereum, there are two types of accounts: externally owned accounts, controlled by people’s private keys and containing no code, and contract accounts, controlled by their code. ([Location 1395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X8HS2WC&location=1395))
- A DAO was the groundbreaking idea of creating a computer-run organization. The business’s rules would be set in a computer program and executed with as little human involvement as possible. Because the organization would be built on top of a public blockchain like Ethereum, decision making and flow of funds would be fully transparent, uncensorable, and immutable.
