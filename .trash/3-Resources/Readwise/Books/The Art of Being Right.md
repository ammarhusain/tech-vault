## Highlights
- Dialectic (from [Greek: dialegesthai], “to converse”— and every conversation communicates either facts or opinions, that is to say, it is historical or deliberative) as “the art of disputation,” ([Location 27](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=27))
- Dialectic, for the most part, can be constructed only à posteriori; that is to say, we may learn its rules by an experiential knowledge of the disturbance which pure thought suffers through the difference of individuality manifested in the intercourse between two rational beings, and also by acquaintance with the means which disputants adopt in order to make good against one another their own individual thought, ([Location 35](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=35))
- Controversial Dialectic is the art of disputing, and of disputing in such a way as to hold one’s own, whether one is in the right or the wrong ([Location 44](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=44))
- Aristotle put Rhetoric and Dialectic together, as aiming at persuasion, [Greek: to pithanon]; and Analytic and Philosophy as aiming at truth. ([Location 48](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=48))
- Aristotle does, indeed, distinguish between (1) Logic, or Analytic, as the theory or method of arriving at true or apodeictic conclusions; and (2) Dialectic as the method of arriving at conclusions that are accepted or pass current as true, ([Location 49](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=49))
- (3) Eristic is the method by which the form of the conclusion is correct, but the premisses, the materials from which it is drawn, are not true, but only appear to be true. Finally (4) Sophistic is the method in which the form of the conclusion is false, although it seems correct. ([Location 55](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=55))
- If human nature were not base, but thoroughly honourable, we should in every debate have no other aim than the discovery of truth; we should not in the least care whether the truth proved to be in favour of the opinion which we had begun by expressing, or of the opinion of our adversary. ([Location 60](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=60))
- perversity of our will lend ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=75))
    - Note: ?? Missong word
- If honour and fidelity prevailed in the world, it would be a different matter; but as these are qualities not to be expected, a man must not practise them himself, because he will meet with a bad return. ([Location 79](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=79))
- For it often happens that in a matter in which a man is really in the right, he is confounded or refuted by merely superficial arguments; and if he emerges victorious from a contest, he owes it very often not so much to the correctness of his judgment in stating his proposition, as to the cunning and address with which he defended it. ([Location 90](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=90))
- But even when a man has the right on his side, he needs Dialectic in order to defend and maintain it; he must know what the dishonest tricks are, in order to meet them; nay, he must often make use of them himself, so as to beat the enemy with his own weapons. ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=129))
- Dialectic, then, need have nothing to do with truth, as little as the fencing master considers who is in the right when a dispute leads to a duel. Thrust and parry is the whole business. Dialectic is the art of intellectual fencing; ([Location 136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=136))
- Thrust and parry is the whole business. Dialectic is the art of intellectual fencing; ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=137))
- The direct attacks the reason for the thesis; the indirect, its results. The direct refutation shows that the thesis is not true; the indirect, that it cannot be true. ([Location 161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=161))
- The direct refutation makes use either of the diversion or of the instance. ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=164))
- The diversion. — We accept our opponent’s proposition as true, and then show what follows from it when we bring it into connection with some other proposition acknowledged to be true. ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=165))
    - Note: Ad absurdum
- We cannot argue with those who deny principles: ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=179))
- The Extension. — This consists in carrying your opponent’s proposition beyond its natural limits; in giving it as general a signification and as wide a sense as possible, so as to exaggerate it; and, on the other hand, in giving your own proposition as restricted a sense and as narrow limits as you can, because the more general a statement becomes, the more numerous are the objections to which it is open. ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=182))
- The Homonymy. — This trick is to extend a proposition to something which has little or nothing in common with the matter in question but the similarity of the word; ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=204))
- It would be a very good thing if every trick could receive some short and obviously appropriate name, so that when a man used this or that particular trick, he could be at once reproached for it. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=213))
- take a proposition which is laid down relatively, and in reference to some particular matter, as though it were uttered with a general or absolute application; ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=226))
- If you want to draw a conclusion, you must not let it be foreseen, but you must get the premisses admitted one by one, unobserved, mingling them here and there in your talk; otherwise, your opponent will attempt all sorts of chicanery. ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=241))
- For instance, if he is a member of some sect to which you do not belong, you may employ the declared, opinions of this sect against him, as principles.* ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=251))
- The plan is to ask a great many wide-reaching questions at once, so as to hide what you want to get admitted, and, on the other hand, quickly propound the argument resulting from the admissions; for those who are slow of understanding cannot follow accurately, and do not notice any mistakes or gaps there may be in the demonstration. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=263))
- making your opponent angry; for when he is angry he is incapable of judging aright, and perceiving where his advantage lies. ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=265))
- If you observe that your opponent designedly returns a negative answer to the questions which, for the sake of your proposition, you want him to answer in the affirmative, you must ask the converse of the proposition, ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=269))
- If you make an induction, and your opponent grants you the particular cases by which it is to be supported, you must refrain from asking him if he also admits the general truth which issues from the particulars, but introduce it afterwards as a settled and admitted fact; ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=272))
- some general conception which has no particular name, but requires some figurative or metaphorical designation, you must begin by choosing a metaphor that is favourable to your proposition. ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=276))
- What one man calls “placing in safe custody,” another calls “throwing into prison.” ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=285))
- Of all the tricks of controversy, this is the most frequent, and it is used instinctively. You hear of “religious zeal,” or “fanaticism”; a “faux pas“ a “piece of gallantry,” or “adultery”; an “equivocal,” or a “bawdy” story; “embarrassment,” or “bankruptcy”; “through influence and connection,” or by “bribery and nepotism”; “sincere gratitude,” or “good pay.” ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=286))
- To make your opponent accept a proposition, you must give him the counter-proposition as well, leaving him his choice of the two; and you must render the contrast as glaring as you can, ... It is as though you were to put grey next black, and call it white; or next white, and call it black. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=289))
- Another trick is to use arguments ad hominem, or ex concessis* When your opponent makes a proposition, you must try to see whether it is not in some way — if needs be, only apparently — inconsistent with some other proposition which he has made or admitted, or with the principles of a school or sect which he has commended and approved, or with the actions of those who support the sect, ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=303))
- If your opponent presses you with a counter-proof, you will often be able to save yourself by advancing some subtle distinction, which, it is true, had not previously occurred to you; ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=315))
- Should your opponent expressly challenge you to produce any objection to some definite point in his argument, and you have nothing much to say, you must try to give the matter a general turn, and then talk against that. If you are called upon to say why a particular physical hypothesis cannot be accepted, you may speak of the fallibility of human knowledge, ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=320))
- If your opponent requires you to admit something from which the point in dispute will immediately follow, you must refuse to do so, declaring that it is a petitio principii ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=330))
- It will often happen that your opponent will himself directly try to extend your statement further than you meant it; here you must at once stop him, and bring him back to the limits which you set up; “That’s what I said, and no more.” ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=336))
- This is a case of the diversion by means of an instance to the contrary. With an induction ([Greek: epagogae]), a great number of particular instances are required in order to establish it as a universal proposition; but with the diversion ([Greek: apagogae]) a single instance, to which the proposition does not apply, is all that is necessary to overthrow it. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=342))
- If you find that you are being worsted, you can make a diversion — that is, you can suddenly begin to talk of something else, as though it had a bearing on the matter in dispute, and afforded an argument against your opponent. ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=369))
- argumentum ad verecundiam. It consists in making an appeal to authority rather than reason, and in using such an authority as may suit the degree of knowledge possessed by your opponent. Every man prefers belief to the exercise of judgment, says Seneca; and it is therefore an easy matter if you have an authority on your side which your opponent respects. ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=385))
- But to speak seriously, the universality of an opinion is no proof, nay, it is not even a probability, that the opinion is right. ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=405))
- If he is secretly conscious of his own weakness, and accustomed to hear much that he does not understand, and to make as though he did, you can easily impose upon him by some serious fooling that sounds very deep or learned, and deprives him of hearing, sight, and thought; and by giving out that it is the most indisputable proof of what you assert. It is a well-known fact that in recent times some philosophers have practised this trick on the whole of the public with the most brilliant success. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=476))
- XXXVIII. A last trick is to become personal, insulting, rude, as soon as you perceive that your opponent has the upper hand, and that you are going to come off worst. It consists in passing from the subject of dispute, as from a lost game, to the disputant himself, and in some way attacking his person. It may be called the argumentum ad personam, ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=486))
- as Hobbes observes,* all mental pleasure consists in being able to compare oneself with others to one’s own advantage. Nothing is of greater moment to a man than the gratification of his vanity, and no wound is more painful than that which is inflicted on it. Hence such phrases as “Death before dishonour,” and so on. ([Location 495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=495))
- The only safe rule, therefore, is that which Aristotle mentions in the last chapter of his Topica: not to dispute with the first person you meet, but only with those of your acquaintance of whom you know that they possess sufficient intelligence and self-respect not to advance absurdities; to appeal to reason and not to authority, and to listen to reason and yield to it; and, finally, to cherish truth, to be willing to accept reason even from an opponent, and to be just enough to bear being proved to be in the wrong, should truth lie with him. From this it follows that scarcely one man in a hundred is worth your disputing with him. You may let the remainder say what they please, for every one is at liberty to be a fool ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=506))
- The beauty of a work of art consists in the fact that it holds up a clear mirror to certain ideas inherent in the world in general; the beauty of a work of poetic art in particular is that it renders the ideas inherent in mankind, and thereby leads it to a knowledge of these ideas. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=516))
- It is obvious that what is affected by poetry of this character is our will, and not merely our intellectual powers pure and simple. The word interest means, therefore, that which arouses the concern of the individual will, quod nostrâ interest; and here it is that beauty is clearly distinguished from interest. The one is an affair of the intellect, and that, too, of the purest and simplest kind. The other works upon the will. ([Location 533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=533))
- A drama or a novel may often attract us by its interest, and yet be so utterly deficient in any kind of beauty that we are afterwards ashamed of having wasted our time on it. ([Location 572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=572))
- For the mob this is the right thing: it looks for amusement, something to pass the time, not for intellectual perception. Beauty is an affair of such perception; hence sensibility to beauty varies as much as the intellectual faculties themselves. ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=578))
- Our temperament is so despotic that we are not satisfied unless we draw everything into our own life, and force all the world to sympathise with us. The only way of achieving this would be to win the love of others, so that the afflictions which oppress our own hearts might oppress theirs as well. Since that is attended with some difficulty, we often choose the shorter way, and blab out our burden of woe to people who do not care, and listen with curiosity, but without sympathy, and much oftener with satisfaction. Speech and the communication of thought, which, in their mutual relations, are always attended by a slight impulse on the part of the will, are almost a physical necessity. ([Location 650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=650))
- How often do we complain that we cannot remember one thousandth part of what we read! In both cases, however, we may console ourselves with the reflection that the things we see and read make an impression on the mind before they are forgotten, and so contribute to its formation and nurture; while that which we only remember does no more than stuff it and puff it out, filling up its hollows with matter that will always be strange to it, and leaving it in itself a blank. ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=695))
- Finally, it is for the same reason that great superiority of mind isolates a man, and that those of high gifts keep themselves aloof from the vulgar (and that means every one); for if they mingle with the crowd, they can communicate only such parts of them as they share with the crowd, and so make themselves common. ([Location 720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=720))
- If we regard our existence as the work of some arbitrary power outside us, we must, indeed, admire the cunning by which that creative mind has succeeded in making us place so much value on an object which is only momentary and must of necessity be laid aside very soon, and which we see, moreover, on reflection, to be altogether vanity — in making, I say, this object so dear to us that we eagerly exert all our strength in working at it; although we knew that as soon as the game is over, the object will exist for us no longer, and that, on the whole, we cannot say what it is that makes it so attractive. ([Location 736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=736))
- the average man pursues the shadow of happiness with unwearied labour; and the thinker, the shadow of truth; and both, though phantoms are all they have, possess in them as much as they can grasp. Life is a language in which certain truths are conveyed to us; could we learn them in some other way, we should not live. ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=749))
- Recognise the truth in yourself, recognise yourself in the truth; and in the same moment you will find, to your astonishment, that the home which you have long been looking for in vain, which has filled your most ardent dreams, is there in its entirety, with every detail of it true, in the very place where you stand. It is there that your heaven touches your earth. ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=756))
- You know that you cannot like a man who does not show himself friendly to you; you know that he cannot do so for any length of time unless he likes you, and that he cannot like you unless you show that you are friendly to him; then do it: your false friendliness will gradually become a true one. ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=776))
- As a rule, the fear of the ills we know drive us into the contrary ills; the pain of solitude, for example, drives us into society, and the first society that comes; the discomforts of society drive us into solitude; we exchange a forbidding demeanour for incautious confidence and so on. ([Location 792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=792))
- I observed once to Goethe, in complaining of the illusion and vanity of life, that when a friend is with us we do not think the same of him as when he is away. He replied: “Yes! because the absent friend is yourself, and he exists only in your head; whereas the friend who is present has an individuality of his own, and moves according to laws of his own, which cannot always be in accordance with those which you form for yourself.” ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=811))
- A man’s nature is in harmony with itself when he desires to be nothing but what he is; that is to say, when he has attained by experience a knowledge of his strength and of his weakness, and makes use of the one and conceals the other, instead of playing with false coin, and trying to show a strength which he does not possess. ([Location 856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=856))
- The sublime melancholy which leads us to cherish a lively conviction of the worthlessness of everything of all pleasures and of all mankind, and therefore to long for nothing, but to feel that life is merely a burden which must be borne to an end that cannot be very distant, is a much happier state of mind than any condition of desire, which, be it never so cheerful, would have us place a value on the illusions of the world, and strive to attain them. ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=905))
- Therefore, as regards our own welfare, there are only two ways in which we can use wealth. We can either spend it in ostentatious pomp, and feed on the cheap respect which our imaginary glory will bring us from the infatuated crowd; or, by avoiding all expenditure that will do us no good, we can let our wealth grow, so that we may have a bulwark against misfortune and want that shall be stronger and better every day; in view of the fact that life, though it has few delights, is rich in evils. ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=948))

- in the realm of metaphysics it was held for a still longer period that the ego was a simple and consequently an indestructible entity. I have shown, however, that it is composed of two heterogeneous parts, namely, the Will, which is metaphysical in its character, a thing in itself, and the knowing subject, which is physical and a mere phenomenon. ([Location 964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=964))
- In music the finest compositions are the most difficult to understand. They are only for the trained intelligence. They consist of long movements, where it is only after a labyrinthine maze that the fundamental note is recovered. It is just so with genius; it is only after a course of struggle, and doubt, and error, and much reflection and vacillation, that great minds attain their equilibrium. It is the longest pendulum that makes the greatest swing. ([Location 1081](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UCWDW92&location=1081))
