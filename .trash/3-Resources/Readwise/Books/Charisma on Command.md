## Highlights
- Charisma = Conviction + Energy + Presentation ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MX95J48&location=295))
- Conviction is the heart of charisma.  It is the belief that things will work out.  That somehow, someway your goals will be achieved.  That no matter what, it will all be okay.  It is confidence in the face of the unknown.  Certainty in the face of naysayers and haters. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MX95J48&location=346))
- Build conviction in everything you do and people will respect, support, and believe in you.  Conviction is mind control.  Conviction is magic. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MX95J48&location=414))
- Everything will be okay.  You’ll regret the chances you didn’t take more than the ones you did.  When you realize this, risks become more worthwhile and people flock to your example. ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MX95J48&location=480))
- Focus more on being the person you want to be rather than on being perceived as the person you want to be. ([Location 504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MX95J48&location=504))
