- It's good to get higher credit limits to minimize the % credit used.
- Dr Brad Klontz ([yourmentalwealth.com](http://yourmentalwealth.com/)), a professor in financial psychology, coined the term “invisible money scripts” to describe “typically unconscious, trans generational beliefs about money” that are developed in childhood and drive your behavior today.
- When there’s a sale on eggs or chicken, we’re happy - but when the stock market gets cheaper, we think its bad. Long term investors should love when the market drops. You can buy more shares for the same price.
- Prefer rolling 401(k) money into an IRA. Gives you more control on how to invest.
- Conscious spenders care about the value of something.
- When it comes to your Rich Life, if you’re counting pennies or calculating a sandwich as being worth $90000 you’ve taken a very wrong turn somewhere. You start to think that the only way to manage money is to hoard it and create an increasingly long list of no's. Soon the guilt isn’t just coming from money experts & the outside world. It’s coming from you.
- I believe that if you get the Big Wins in life right, you’ll never have to worry about the price of lunch.
- To find your hourly rate, divide your salary by two and drop the three zeros.

- Fiduciary: They put your financial interests first. You should be paying 0.1 to 0.3% in fees.
- Crossover Point: your investments were generating so much money that your money was actually producing more money than your salary. When your money is generating so much new money that all of your expenses are covered is when you are “financially independent”.
- Many FIRE adherents exhibit classic signs of stress, anxiety and even depression. They think that hitting some mythical number in their spreadsheet will solve their unhappiness. It won’t.
- Ideally you should have just one - a target date fund. You can create a great asset allocation using anywhere from three to seven funds.
- “Dollar cost averaging” is a phrase that refers to investing regular amounts over time, rather than investing all your money in a fund at once.
  If you have a chunk of cash, what's better: dollar cost averaging or lump sum investing? Vanguard research found that lump sum investing actually beats dollar cost averaging two thirds of the time. Because the market tends to go up & stocks & bonds tend to outperform cash.
- I’ve seen too many people decide to take control of their finances (good), then change their lives to save money, then continue saving & become increasingly aggressive, and finally end up “living in the spreadsheet”. They’re become obsessed with the game without realizing why they're playing it.
- For me, a Rich Life is about freedom - it’s about not having to think about money all the time and being able to travel and work on things that interest me. It’s about being able to use money to do whatever I want - and not having to worry about taking a taxi or ordering what I want at a restaurant or how I’ll ever be able to afford a house.
- Buying a house: in the olden days, it meant that the house would cost no more than 2.5 times your annual income.
