## Highlights
#### Rule 1: Fix Your Posture - Others Will Treat You with More Respect
- The neurotransmitter serotonin is thought to be the internal mediator of social status. If you feel (or are) dominant in status, more serotonin circulates in your bloodstream. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/29261b13-8b84-45f9-ac4d-36f92a8d40d6))
- there’s a hypothesis that depression is so common today because mass media makes you compare yourself to the best of billions of other people. On this unprecedented world stage, you’re not particularly good at anything. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/7299d1fb-59bb-4e0a-8a8d-b5736f472304))
- through feedback loops, you can become stuck in a low social position. You behave in a subordinate way, which makes others treat you as a subordinate, which makes you feel more subordinate, which makes you behave subordinately.

- You might worry that all this posturing will make you a target for attack by stronger people. Peterson argues that the ability to respond with aggression decreases the probability that actual aggression will become necessary. In other words, acting confidently is a deterrent to attack.

#### Rule 2: Take Care of Yourself, the Way You Would Take Care of Someone Else
#### Rule 3: Surround Yourself with People Who Want You to Succeed
- Even if the friendship isn’t a charity case, be wary of people who insidiously drag you down. They belittle your personal ambition because they’re embarrassed about lack of their own. They override your accomplishments with their own, real or imaginary. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/87ec5f2a-4613-4f81-bd8d-5904e042941e))
#### Rule 4: Judge Yourself by Your Own Goals, Not by Others’
- you’re likely only seeing the highlight reel from other people. They don’t expose their deep problems and failing. You’re likely overvaluing what you don’t have and undervaluing what you do. Even the very people you envy might secretly envy you, in ways you’re not aware. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/c0184950-5ea0-4b8c-a377-9c01d3b8bf17))
- You’re blind to what goals you really want because you’re focusing on something very narrow. You’ve obsessed over a narrow goal for a long time, so it’ll take an adjustment period to see the bigger picture. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/58b6cfc8-a18b-4173-a994-31ce46641048))
- answer to nihilism is the “essential goodness of Being.” This comes from aiming for a meaningful goal that improves the lives of people and for a long time. There is beauty to create and order to make in the world. There’s evil to defeat and misery to soothe.

#### Rule 5: As a Parent, Train Your Children to Follow the Rules of Society
#### Rule 6: Think: Have I Done Everything Within My Ability?
- Are you doing anything you know is wrong? Stop it today. Stop when you feel when an inkling that you should stop. Stop saying things that make you feel ashamed and cowardly; start saying things that make you feel strong. Do only those things about which you would speak with honor.

#### Rule 7: Do What is Meaningful, and You Will Feel Better About Existing
- g the kingdoms. Jesus rejects these options - he wants to undergo his trials without powers that ordinary humans don’t ha ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/0a79e9ba-c9aa-42e1-8cb6-88addcb956ec))
#### Rule 8: Act Only in Line With Your Personal Truth - Stop Lying
- Ambitions based around developing character and ability are better than status and power. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/f49ed76b-b5aa-466b-8f78-8d5d78242807))
- Nietzsche said that “the strength of a person’s spirit” is “measured by how much truth he could tolerate...to what extent he needs to have it diluted, disguised, sweetened.” ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/9846aa5f-3cb1-4fa3-9d9b-8443b54bc89d))
#### Rule 9: Listen to Other People Thoughtfully - You’ll Learn Something
- Good lectures are actually conversations that happen to be given to many individuals at once. As a public speaker, you should talk with individuals. Make eye contact with a specific person, note her confusion or acceptance, and modify your conversation accordingly. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/9e1c212d-4173-4fb4-8e8a-4197a6b430ed))
#### Rule 10: Define Your Problem Specifically - It Becomes Easier to Deal With
- Specificity turns chaos into a thing that you can deal with. If you have a vague unease, you will struggle with it until you define it explicitly and give it a concrete form. Once you precisely identify the issue, you will likely realize that you were far more afraid than you should have been, and you now have a specific target to confront. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/e67c8f68-912f-4504-b829-9263e3a83904))
#### Rule 11: Accept that Inequality Exists
#### Rule 12: Take Time to Indulge in Little Bits of Goodness
- What can be loved about a person can’t be separated from their limitations. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/279efcbb-1b5e-4a17-b20c-b72fa0546fd5))
