## Highlights
- An act like this is prepared within the silence of the heart, as is a great work of art. ([Location 107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HLQQZ3L&location=107))
- Dying voluntarily implies that you have recognized, even instinctively, the ridiculous character of that habit, the absence of any profound reason for living, the insane character of that daily agitation, and the uselessness of suffering. ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HLQQZ3L&location=122))
- A world that can be explained even with bad reasons is a familiar world. But, on the other hand, in a universe suddenly divested of illusions and lights, man feels an alien, a stranger. ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HLQQZ3L&location=125))

- His exile is without remedy since he is deprived of the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land. This divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting, is properly the feeling of absurdity. ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HLQQZ3L&location=126))
