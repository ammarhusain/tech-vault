## Highlights
- IF EACH LETTER OF THE ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA TAKES 6 OR 7 BITS OF INFORMATION, WE WOULD NEED TO STORE ABOUT 10^15 BITS TO HAVE EVERYTHING IN EVERY BOOK IN THE WORLD. BUT IF FOR EACH BIT I ALLOW A CUBE OF 5X5X5 ATOMS, ALL OF THE INFORMATION IN ALL THE BOOKS IN THE WORLD CAN BE WRITTEN DOWN IN A CUBE OF MATERIAL ABOUT 1/200TH OF AN INCH WIDE. (PageÂ 158)
- FROM HIM I LEARNED WE CAN IMAGINE THAT THIS COMPLICATED ARRAY OF MOVING THINGS "THE WORLD"-IS SORTA LIKE A GREAT GAME PLAYED BY THE GODS, AND WE'RE OBSERVERS.
