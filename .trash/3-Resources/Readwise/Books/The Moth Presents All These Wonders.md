## Highlights
- Honesty matters. Vulnerability matters. Being open about who you were at a moment in time when you were in a difficult or an impossible place matters more than anything. ([Location 149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=149))
- For some of my friends, certainly not all, but for some, and definitely for me, they even made us think, Well, shit, if (a) I like talking about ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=272))
- But really, I think that when we stood at that same crossroads as our parents had, it was this experience that gave us something that unfortunately they didn’t have, and that’s just the confidence to know that we had a choice. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=274))
- Judgment and Risk! Tara lives in New York City with her wife and two sons. More info at taraclancy.com. This story was told on February 10, 2014, in the Great Hall at Cooper Union in New York City. The theme of the evening ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=282))
- My silence allowed me to experience things, to participate in my childhood, to do things I hadn’t been able to do as a child. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=408))
- But I wish I had been able to tell them early on, because I wanted them to understand how lucky they were to have a mother, a father, grandparents, siblings. People who annoyed them by caring about them so much and calling them all the time to make sure they were okay. ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=410))
- So everyone goes home, and Ronnie and I end up in this hotel room together, putting on his psoriasis medicine. And I have no plan at all. ([Location 470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=470))
- And after his death, I thought a lot about the lessons I had learned from Ronnie Simonsen. About the importance of having a biggest dream, no matter how silly it is. ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=531))
- “Just walk fearlessly into the house of mourning, for grief is just love squaring up to its oldest enemy. And after all these mortal human years, love is up to the challenge.” ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=622))
- When I arrived at the beach, there was a crescent moon, which was partly obscured by the clouds that were being chased across the sky by the wind, which had picked up. The storm had also driven the white of the waves towards the land, and it was this desolate, empty beach with just a couple of boulders. In the background there were trees, and they were swaying—very menacing. ([Location 755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=755))
    - Note: Describing the scene
- ancient stoic dictum: accept what you can’t change. ([Location 807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=807))
- for the God I now believe in is much closer to Spinoza’s God than the God of Michelangelo’s painting or the God of the Old Testament. ([Location 831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=831))
- “Go for it. Enjoy it while it lasts, but brace yourself, because when it doesn’t, sometimes you’ve got to figure out who you’re not so you can become who you are.” ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=1058))
- To a twenty-four-year-old woman, this was a devastating and defining moment. That night she confessed a fear that she had always had: no one will come to my party. ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=1137))
- RJ would be twenty-seven years old. I still have that strong maternal love for him. The challenge now is to channel it, so it doesn’t become corrosive. ([Location 1386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=1386))
- So he gave them him his actual ([Location 1491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=1491))

- Like keep your sense of humor at all costs. Or embrace the absurdity of the situations in which you find yourself. ([Location 1498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=1498))
- her need would met by a heavily ([Location 1576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=1576))

- This is what I know. In the deepest, blackest night of despair, if you can get just one pinhole of light…all of grace rushes in. ([Location 2353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=2353))
- I’m thinking about the fact that we imagine that we live in the light. We imagine we can foresee what’s gonna happen. We imagine we can control everything: I’m gonna do this, and I’m gonna do that. But the reality is, almost all of us are just stumbling along in the dark, searching, trying to reach some kind of home, while we’re juggling all these balls and hopefully on most days keeping them afloat. ([Location 2820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=2820))
- And when I did get the job, I didn’t have the glamorous experience that I imagined I would have when I was ten and I was watching that show on a shitty black-and-white TV. But I actually had a much more important experience. Because what I learned was to be brave. SNL taught me that you can’t be afraid to put something out into the world that’s yours, something that’s totally different and that you believe in. ([Location 3620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=3620))
- Brave men are always afraid. Courage isn’t the absence of fear. It’s the willingness—the guts, if you like—to face the fear. They faced their fears. And they left. ([Location 3868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=3868))
- the world is always trying to tell you what you’re not. And it’s really up to you to say what you are. ([Location 4034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=4034))
- She said that things were going to be however they were going to be—because of us and in spite of us. And that was such a relief to hear her say. She lifted a weight off my soul. ([Location 4213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=4213))
- To put that in perspective, when the Apollo astronauts went to the moon, it took over three days. For New Horizons the spacecraft passed the moon in just nine hours. ([Location 4332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=4332))
- That was not life. A friend of mine told me that when you hate, you take poison and you expect the other person to die. And I think that’s true. Revenge and anger hold you in the past; forgiveness can free you to go into the future. ([Location 4460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=4460))
- But childhood is a place where your fears are disproportionate. My fears were so huge. But so were my goals. And…and that’s where the magic can happen, in these goals. ([Location 4496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HL1CE5E&location=4496))
