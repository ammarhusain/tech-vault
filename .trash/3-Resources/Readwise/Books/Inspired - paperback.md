## Highlights
### LESSONS FROM TOP TECH COMPANIES
- These requirements might be user stories, or they might be more like some form of a functional specification. Their purpose is to communicate with the designers and engineers what needs to be built. (Page 16)
- One of the most critical lessons in product is knowing what we can't know, and we just can't know at this stage how much money we'll make.
  Likewise, we have no idea what it will cost to build. Without knowing the actual solution, this is extremely hard for engineering to predict (Page 18)
- The first truth is that at least half of our ideas are just not going to work. (Page 19)
- If it’s way too late in the game to get the real value of design : "lipstick on the pig" model. The damage has already been done, and now we're just trying to put a coat of paint on the mess. (Page 20)
- Biggest missed opportunity is when engineering gets brought in way too late. We say if you're just using your engineers to code, you're only getting about half their value. The little secret in product is that engineers are typically the best single source of innovation. (Page 20)
- This entire process is very project-centric. The company usually funds projects, staffs projects, pushes projects through the organization, and finally launches projects. Unfortunately, projects are output and product is all about outcome. This process predictably leads to orphaned projects. (Page 20)
- Risks are tackled up front, rather than at the end.
  usability risk - whether users can figure out how to use it
  value risk - whether customers will buy it
  feasibility risk - whether our engineers can build what we need with the time, skills, and technology we have
  business viability risk - whether this solution will make money (Page 24)
- Products are defined and designed collaboratively, rather than sequentially.
  In strong teams, product, design, and engineering work side by side, in a give-and-take way, to come up with technology-powered solutions that our customers love and that work for our business (Page 24)
- Its all about solving problems, not implementing features. Conventional product roadmaps are all about output. Strong teams know it's not only about implementing a solution. They must ensure that solution solves the underlying problem.
  It's about business results. (Page 24)
- There are two essential high-level activities in all product teams. We need to discover the product to be built, and we need to deliver that product to market. The MVP should be a prototype, not a product. (Page 26)
### THE RIGHT PEOPLE
- A product team is a group of people who bring together different specialized skills and responsibilities and feel real ownership for a product or at least a substantial piece of a larger product. (Page 33)
    - Note: Kind of like the Interventions Tracking Working Group. It would make sense to create ones for specific & specialized goals. Eg: Unrequested Interventions
- John Doerr, the famous Silicon Valley venture capitalist: "We need teams of missionaries, not teams of mercenaries."
  Mercenaries build whatever they're told to build. Missionaries are true believers in the vision and are committed to solving problems for their customers. (Page 34)
- A product team is a set of highly skilled people who come together for an extended period of time to solve hard business problems. (Page 35)
- The honest truth is that the product manager needs to be the product manager needs to be among the strongest talent in the company. If the product manager doesn't have the technology sophistication, doesn't have the business savvy, doesn't have the credibility with the key executives, doesn't have the deep customer knowledge, doesn't have the passion for the product, or doesn't have the respect of their product team, then it's a sure recipe for failure. (Page 42)
- Successful products are not only loved by your customers, but they work for your business.
  Four critical contributions you need to bring to your team: deep knowledge 
  (1) of your customer, 
  (2) of the data, 
  (3) of your business and its stakeholders, and
  (4) of your market and industry. (Page 46)
- True leadership is a big part of what separates the great product people from the merely good ones. So, no matter what your title or level may be, if you aspire to be great, don't be afraid to lead. (Page 50)
- In strong teams today, the design informs the functionality at least as much as the functionality drives the design. This is a hugely important concept. For this to happen, we need to make design a first-class member of the product team, sitting side by side with the product manager, and not a supporting service. (Page 58)
- Just as most product managers don't like it when an executive or stakeholder spells out exactly what they want you to build, engineers generally don't like it when you try to spell out how to build something. You want to give your engineers as much latitude as possible in coming up with the best solution. (Page 60)
- A tech lead not only has broad tech knowledge - and is responsible for helping to share this knowledge with the other engineers on the team - but the tech lead also has an explicit responsibility to help the product manager and product designer discover a strong solution. (Page 61)
- Qualitative learning, some of our research is generative, which is understanding the problems we need to solve; and some of our research is evaluative, which is assessing how well our solutions solve the problem. User researchers are trained in this range of qualitative techniques. They can help you find the right type of users, craft the right types of tests, and learn the most from each user or customer interaction. (Page 68)
- Realize that developing great people requires a different set of skills than developing great products, which is why many otherwise excellent product managers and designers never progress to leading organizations. (Page 80)
- The product leader should be expert on modern forms of product planning, customer discovery, product discovery, and product development process, but execution also means that they know how to work effectively as part of an organization of your size. (Page 82)

    - Note: - missing - "an" expert
- If your engineers and architects are only being used to write software, then you are only getting a fraction of the value from them you should be. (Page 89)

    - Note: - missing - “that” you should be
- There are some critical core principles of structuring product teams, and the key is to understand those principles and then weigh the options for your particular circumstances:
  1. Alignment with investment strategy
  2. Minimize Dependencies
  3. Ownership and Autonomy 
  4. Maximize Leverage - try to avoid reinventing the wheel
  5. Product Vision and Strategy
  6. Team Size
  7. Alignment with Architecture
  8. Alignment with User or Customer
  9. Alignment with Business
  10. Structure Is a Moving Target (Page 94)
### THE RIGHT PRODUCT
- Product roadmap is a prioritized list of features and projects your team has been asked to work on. These product roadmaps are usually done on a quarterly basis, but sometimes they are a rolling three months, and some companies do annual roadmaps. (Page 108)
- Product discovery is the most important core competency of a product organization.
  If we can prototype and test ideas with users, customers, engineers, and business stakeholders in hours and days rather than in weeks and months - it changes the dynamics, and most important, the results. (Page 112)
- Anytime you put a list of ideas on a document entitled “roadmap” no matter how many disclaimers you put on it, people across the company will interpret the items as a commitment. And that's the crux of the problem, because now you're committed to building and delivering this thing, even when it doesn't solve the underlying problem. (Page 113)
- Prioritized business objectives for each product team:
  The idea behind business objectives is simple enough: tell the team what you need them to accomplish and how the results will be measured, and let the team figure out the best way to solve the problems. (Page 116)
- Good example of a business objective for one or more product teams: “Dramatically reduce the time it takes for a new customer to go live." And one of the measurable key results would be “Average new customer onboarding time less than three hours." (Page 116)
- Outcome-based roadmaps : It is all about outcome rather than output. Each item is stated as a business problem to solve rather than the feature or project that may or may not solve it. (Page 118)
- The product strategy is our sequence of products or releases we plan to deliver on the path to realizing the product vision. (Page 124)
- The difference between vision and strategy is analogous to the difference between good leadership and good management.
  Leadership inspires and sets the direction, and management helps get us there. (Page 126)
- 10 key principles for coming up with an effective Product Vision:
  1. Start with why.
  2. Fall in love with the problem, not with the solution. 
  3. Don't be afraid to think big with vision.
  4. Don't be afraid to disrupt yourselves because, if you don't, someone else will. 
  5. The product vision needs to inspire.
  6. Determine and embrace relevant and meaningful trends.
  7. Skate to where the puck is heading, not to where it was.
  8. Be stubborn on vision but flexible on the details. 
  9. Realize that any product vision is a leap of faith.
  10. Evangelize continuously and relentlessly. There is no such thing as over-communicating when it comes to explaining and selling the vision. (Page 129)
- Five principles for a good Product Strategy:
  1. Focus on one target market or persona at a time.
  2. Product strategy needs to be aligned with business strategy.
  3. Product strategy needs to be aligned with sales and goto-market strategy. 
  4. Obsess over customers, not over competitors.
  5. Communicate the strategy across the organization. This is part of evangelizing the vision. (Page 133)
- Where the product vision describes the future you want to create, and the product strategy describes your path to achieving that vision, the product principles speak to the nature of the products you want to create. (Page 135)
- General George Patton: "Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do, and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.” (Page 137)

- Objectives should be qualitative; key results need to be quantitative/measurable.
  Objectives do not need to cover every little thing the team does, but they should cover what the team needs to accomplish.
  Key results should be a measure of business results, not output or tasks. (Page 140)
- The heads of product and technology are responsible for the product team objectives. The individual product teams are responsible for proposing the key results for each objective they've been assigned. (Page 141)
- OKRs help to ensure that each team is aligned with the objectives of the company.
  As an organization scales, OKRs become an increasingly necessary tool for ensuring that each product team understands how they are contributing to the greater whole. (Page 144)
- The key is that the cascading of OKRs in a product organization needs to be up from the cross-functional product teams to the company or business-unit level. (Page 145)
    - Note: make sure definition of a product team is captured
- When using OKRs at scale, there's a larger burden on leadership and management to ensure that the organization is truly aligned, that each and every product team understands how they fit into the mix, and that they are there to contribute. (Page 149)
- Product evangelism is "selling the dream." It's helping people imagine the future and inspiring them to help create that future.
  For a product lead, this is a very big part of your job. (Page 151)
### THE RIGHT PROCESS
- The purpose of product discovery is to address these critical risks:
  • Will the customer buy this, or choose to use it? (Value risk)
  • Can the user figure out how to use it? (Usability risk)
  • Can we build it? (Feasibility risk)
  • Does this solution work for our business? (Business viability risk) (Page 165)
- Marc Andreessen: "The most important thing is to know what you can't know," (Page 167)
    - Tags: #readwise/qt 
- Opportunity assessment - The idea is to answer four key questions about the discovery work you are about to undertake:
  1. What business objective is this work intended to address? (Objective)
  2. How will you know if you've succeeded? (Key results)
  3. What problem will this solve for our customers? (Customer problem)
  4. What type of customer are we focused on? (Target market) (Page 179)
- Many teams I know consider a high-fidelity user prototype and a story map as their go-to techniques for ‘discovery planning’. (Page 194)
- If you find you are having real trouble recruiting even four or five prospective customers for this effort, then it's very possible you're chasing a problem that isn't that important, and you will almost certainly have a very hard time selling this product - demand validation. (Page 201)
- Bring three people to customer interviews: the product manager, the product designer, and one of the engineers from the team. Usually, the designer drives, the product manager takes notes, and the developer observes. (Page 213)
- Concierge test requires going out to the actual users and customers and asking them to show you how they work so that you can learn how to do their job, and so that you can work on providing them a much better solution. (Page 216)
- The two main types of hack days are directed and undirected. In an undirected hack day, people can explore whatever product ideas they like, so long as it's at least loosely related to the mission of the company.
  In a directed hack day, there's a customer problem. (Page 221)
- Discovery Prototyping techniques:
  Feasibility Prototypes - written by engineers to address technical feasibility risks during product discovery-trying out a new technology, a new algorithm, assessing performance etc .
  User Prototypes - are simulations. There is a wide spectrum, from those intentionally designed to look like wireframes sketched out on paper (low-fidelity user prototypes) all the way up to those that look and feel like the real thing (high-fidelity user prototypes).
  Live-Data Prototypes - to collect actual data so we can prove something, or at least gather some evidence-normally to find out whether an idea (a feature, a design approach, a workflow) really works.
  Wizard of Oz prototype - combines the front end user experience of a high fidelity user prototype but with an actual person behind the scenes performing manually what would ultimately be handled by automation. Great example of ‘build things that don’t scale’. (Page 224)
- Principles of Prototypes:
  - All forms of prototype should require at least an order of magnitude less time and effort as the eventual product.
  - Should force you to think through a problem at a substantially deeper level than if we just talk about it or write something down. 
  - Powerful tool for team collaboration and develop shared understanding.
  - The overarching purpose of any form of prototype is to learn something at a much lower cost in terms of time and effort than building out a product.
  - Many different possible levels of fidelity for a prototype.
  - Primary purpose of a prototype is to tackle one or more product risks (value, usability, feasibility, or viability) in discovery.
  - Prototype as spec - communicate to the engineers and the broader organization what needs to be built. (Page 228)
- Four types of questions we're trying to answer during ‘discovery testing’ :
  1. Will the user or customer choose to use or buy this? (Value)
  2. Can the user figure out how to use this? (Usability)
  3. Can we build this? (Feasibility)
  4. Is this solution viable for our business? (Business viability) (Page 241)
- First, as the market for our products has expanded dramatically due to access globally-and also by way of connected devices-the sheer volume of data has dramatically increased, which gives us interesting and statistically significantly results much faster. (Page 268)
