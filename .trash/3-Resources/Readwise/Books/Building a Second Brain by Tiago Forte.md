## Highlights
- Creativity is the ability to make connections between ideas and information. Productivity is the ability to make effective use of your time and creativity to accomplish a goal. The more creative connections you can make, and the faster you can execute on them, the better you’ll be at knowledge work.

- our ability to do knowledge work is hindered by our brain’s inability to effectively manage today’s information. We have access to an unlimited amount of important information in today’s modern age ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/05829035-bc04-4831-8e4a-a238f755c566))

- Psychologists found no difference in productivity between people working in organized environments and those working in cluttered ones. However, the people in cluttered environments produced more unique and interesting ideas—they were more creative. If the observations from this study on physical work environments hold true for digital work environments, then your creativity might benefit more from a more integrated or “cluttered” ESS ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/e52f7a94-6887-4127-94f1-589f14063bc7))

- first two steps of using your ESS are to record information and sort it into relevant folders where you can utilize it (these are the condense and organize steps of Forte’s CODE system for saving information). These steps are part of the expansion mode of the creative process—they’re designed to gather relevant information that gets your creative juices flowing and sparks new ideas.

- second two steps of using your ESS are to refine your notes to their most important parts and use them to create something (these are the distill and express steps of Forte’s CODE system). These steps are part of the contraction mode of the creative process—they’re designed to narrow the scope of your information and propel you toward the completion of your goals.

- Collector’s Fallacy: collecting and engaging with information is easy and makes you feel like you’ve made progress toward goals even if you haven’t actually created anything. Spending multiple work sessions refining your notes might make you feel like you’ve done something productive with your ESS information when you haven’t actually created anything. This false confidence might ultimately prevent or slow your progress toward your goals. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/2d3ccf07-d9df-4a68-b615-143b19543922))
- Allen suggests that you clearly define the amount of time, energy, and resources needed to complete each task. This ensures that you’re fully prepared to complete a task before starting it ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/8cdf72d0-2571-48e4-b924-cd61f140599e))
- at the end of every work session, you should identify the next steps to guide your next work session. To do this, record:
  The status of your project, such as your biggest challenges or unanswered questions
  Any barriers that you anticipate cropping up in the future 
  Any small details that you might forget before the next session, such as how one idea relates to another or why you changed your mind about something ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/c7e697d4-9e82-4a41-8e13-8c2cbbf633c9))
- perfectionism is a psychological ailment that takes time and practice to overcome. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/9b529239-b772-4340-803c-3301afcad044))
