## Highlights
- she had a quick mind and sound judgment, and the capacity for sustained work. Slowly she had risen, playing by the rules, until she reached the threshold where competence didn’t suffice. ([Location 1006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=1006))
- watching as her male counterparts kept moving up the corporate ladder, playing a bit loose with information passed on between the ninth hole and the ride to the clubhouse, ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=1008))
- kindergarten; they lived in the same neighborhoods, in split-level homes with swimming pools; their fathers coached the same Little League teams; their mothers sponsored ([Location 1071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=1071))
- see, ’cause the tribe is full of warriors. Like Obama … that means ‘Burning Spear.’ The men in our tribe all want to be chief, so my father has to settle these feuds before I can come.” As the words tumbled out of my mouth, and I felt the boys readjust to me, more curious and familiar as we bumped into each other in the line back to class, a part of me really began to believe the story. But another part of me knew that what I was telling them was a lie, something ([Location 1116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=1116))
- horns, the thump of drums, then the guitar again, and then the voices, clean and joyful as they rode up the back beat, urging us on. “Come, Barry,” my father said. “You will ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=1242))
- I learned to slip back and forth between my black and white worlds, understanding that each possessed its own language and customs and structures of meaning, convinced that with a bit of translation on my part the two worlds would eventually cohere. ([Location 1413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=1413))
- “Understand something, boy. You’re not going to college to get educated. You’re going there to get trained. They’ll train you to want what you don’t need. They’ll train you to manipulate words so they don’t mean anything anymore. They’ll train you to forget what it is that you already know. They’ll train you so good, you’ll start believing what they tell you about equal opportunity and the American way and all that shit. They’ll give you a corner office and invite you to fancy dinners, and tell you you’re a credit to your race. Until you want to actually start running things, and then they’ll yank on your chain and let you know that you may be a well-trained, well-paid nigger, but you’re a nigger just the same.” ([Location 1640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=1640))
- What was she asking of me, then? Determination, mostly. The determination to push against whatever power kept her stooped instead of standing straight. The determination to resist the easy or the expedient. You might be locked into a world not of your own making, her eyes said, but you still have a claim on how it is shaped. You still have responsibilities. ([Location 1865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=1865))
- I can see that my choices were never truly mine alone—and that that is how it should be, that to assert otherwise is to chase after a sorry sort of freedom. ([Location 2155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=2155))
- an older black man who still burns from a lifetime of insults, of foiled ambitions, of ambitions abandoned before they’ve been tried. ([Location 2374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=2374))
- Both Marty and Smalls knew that in politics, like religion, power lay in certainty—and that one man’s certainty always threatened another’s. ([Location 2612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=2612))
- But whenever I tried to pin down this idea of self-esteem, the specific qualities we hoped to inculcate, the specific means by which we might feel good about ourselves, the conversation always seemed to follow a path of infinite regress. ([Location 3080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=3080))
- That hate hadn’t gone away; it formed a counternarrative buried deep within each person and at the center of which stood white people—some cruel, some ignorant, sometimes a single face, sometimes just a faceless image of a system claiming power over our lives. ([Location 3103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=3103))
- he had never been present to foil the image, because I hadn’t seen what perhaps most men see at some point in their lives: their father’s body shrinking, their father’s best hopes dashed, their father’s face lined with grief and regret. ([Location 3496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=3496))
- To think that all my life I had been wrestling with nothing more than a ghost! ([Location 3505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=3505))
- “I think you’re just trying to do a good job. But I also think you ain’t never satisfied. You want everything to happen fast. Like you got something to prove out here.” ([Location 3584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=3584))
- There may not be any bad kids, Barack, but there sure are a lot of bad parents. ([Location 4066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=4066))
    - Note: Should This have been in quotes?
- But on this particular evening I have someone staying over; ([Location 4267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=4267))
    - Note: Lol
- They all mentioned periods of religious doubt; the corruption of the world and their own hearts; the striking bottom and shattering of pride; and then finally the resurrection of self, a self alloyed to something larger. ([Location 4412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=4412))
- “It is this world, a world where cruise ships throw away more food in a day than most residents of Port-au-Prince see in a year, where white folks’ greed runs a world in need, apartheid in one hemisphere, apathy in another hemisphere … That’s the world! On which hope sits!” ([Location 4626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=4626))
- I began to imagine an unchanging rhythm of days, lived on firm soil where you could wake up each morning and know that all was how it had been yesterday, ([Location 4862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=4862))
- drew a series of circles around myself, with borders that shifted as time passed and faces changed but that nevertheless offered the illusion of control. An inner circle, where love was constant and claims unquestioned. Then a second circle, a realm of negotiated love, commitments freely chosen. And then a circle for colleagues, acquaintances; the cheerful gray-haired lady who rang up my groceries back in Chicago. Until the circle finally widened to embrace a nation or a race, or a particular moral course, and the commitments were no longer tied to a face or a name but were actually commitments I’d made to myself. ([Location 5131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=5131))
- A part of me wished I could live up to the image that my new relatives imagined for me: a corporate lawyer, an American businessman, my hand poised on the spigot, ready to rain down like manna the largesse of the Western world. ([Location 5163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=5163))
- Her restlessness, her independence, her constant willingness to project into the future—all of this struck the family as unnatural somehow. Unnatural … and un-African. ([Location 5173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=5173))
- same perverse survivor’s guilt that I could expect to experience ([Location 5176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=5176))
- So you have to draw the line somewhere. If everyone is family, no one is family. Your father, he never understood this, ([Location 5285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=5285))
- An impression of loneliness that perhaps wasn’t true, perhaps was just a projection of my own heart, but that, either way, had made me want to run, just as, an ocean away, David had run, back into the marketplace and noisy streets, back into disorder and the laughter disorder produced, back into the sort of pain a boy could understand. ([Location 5334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=5334))
- That’s how the next hour passed, with Ruth alternating between stories of my father’s failure and stories of Mark’s accomplishments. ([Location 5357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=5357))
- One only knows what one knows. Perhaps if I were young today, I would not have accepted these things. Perhaps I would only care about my feelings, and falling in love. But that’s not the world I was raised in. I only know ([Location 6331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=6331))
- what I have seen. What I have not seen doesn’t make my heart heavy.” ([Location 6332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=6332))
- The study of law can be disappointing at times, a matter of applying narrow rules and arcane procedure to an uncooperative reality; a sort of glorified accounting that serves to regulate the affairs of those who have power—and ([Location 6790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=6790))
- The law is also memory; the law also records a long-running conversation, a nation arguing with its conscience. ([Location 6793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000N2HCM4&location=6793))
