## Highlights
### Chapter 1
- And such shallow wisecracks pass as devastating epigrams and the ripest wisdom.
  Today is already the tomorrow which the bad economist yesterday urged us to ignore.
  It is often sadly remarked that the bad economists present their errors to the public better than the good economists present their truths.
### Chapter 3
- But as most people are so firmly in the habit of thinking of their wealth & income in terms of money, they consider themselves better off as these monetary totals rise, in spite of the fact that in terms of things they may have less & buy less. Most of the “good” economic results which people at the time attributed to World War 2 were really owing to wartime inflation.
### Chapter 4
- Everything we get, outside of free gifts of nature, must in some way be paid for.
  All government expenditures must eventually be paid out of the proceeds of taxation; that inflation itself is merely a form, & a particularly vicious form, of taxation.
  The employment argument of the government spenders becomes vivid, & probably for most people convincing. But there are other things that we do not see, because, alas they have never been permitted to come into existence.
### Chapter 6
- There is a strange idea abroad, held by all monetary cranks, that credit is something a banker gives to a man. Credit, on the contrary is something a man already has. He has it, perhaps because he already has marketable assets of a greater cash value than the loan for which he is asking. Or he has it because his character & past record have earned it. He brings it to the bank with him. He is merely exchanging a more liquid form of asset or credit for a less liquid form.
    - Note: Hazlitt argues in this chapter that government shouldn’t give preferential credit. Though question remains in such an unregulated system how do you prevent monopolies or few entities becoming extremely powerful that the playing field is not level anymore.
### Chapter 7
- The belief that machines cause unemployment, when held with any logical consistency, leads to preposterous conclusions. Not only must we be causing unemployment with every technological improvement we make today, but primitive man must have started causing it with the first efforts he made to save himself from needless toil & sweat.
- Santayana’s aphorism that those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
- “Elastic” demand: If a fall in the price of a commodity causes a larger total amount of money to be spent on the commodity than previously.
- Machines bring an increase in production & an increase in the standard of living in 2 ways: Make goods cheaper for consumers or by increasing wages because they increase the productivity of the workers.
### Chapter 9
- When we can find no better argument for the retention of any group of officeholders than that of retaining their purchasing power, it is a sign that the time has come to get rid of them.
### Chapter 10
- We cannot continuously have the fullest production without full employment, we can very easily have full employment without full production. Primitive tribes are naked, & wretchedly fed & housed, but they do not suffer from unemployment.
### Chapter 11
- It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy.
    - Note: P76 (typo): employes -> employees
- By buying English sweater they furnish the English with dollars to buy American goods here. Because we have permitted the British to sell more to us, they are now able to buy more from us. They are in fact eventually forced to buy more from us if their dollar balances are not to remain perpetually unused.
- The tariff has been described as a means of benefiting the producer at the expense of the consumer.
### Chapter 12
- In the long run imports & exports must equal each other. The greater exports we have, the greater imports we must have, if we ever expect to get paid. Without imports we can have no exports, for foreigners will have no funds with which to buy our goods.
  Foreign exchange, in short, is a clearing transaction in which, in America, the dollar debts of foreigners are canceled against their dollar credits. In England, the pound sterling debts of foreigners are canceled against their sterling credits.
  It is true that under the international gold standard discrepancies in balances of imports & exports were sometimes settled by shipments of gold. They could have been settled by any other commodity. Chief difference being that the demand for gold is almost indefinitely expansible.
### Chapter 13
- Rise in farm prices brought by government intervention can be done in several ways: 
  (i) Higher price can be forced by mere edict, which is the least workable method, 
  (ii) Can be done by the govt’s standing ready to buy all farm products offered to it at the parity price, 
  (iii) Govt lending to farmers enough money on their crops to enable them to hold crops off the market until parity prices have realized, 
  (iv) Govt enforcing restrictions in the size of crops.
### Chapter 14
- Paradoxical as it may seem to some, it is just as necessary to the health of a dynamic economy that dying industries be allowed to die as that growing industries be allowed to grow.
### Chapter 15
- “Crusoe Economics”: One occupation can expand only at the expense of all other occupations. As in if someone keeps collecting firewood even if no more wood is needed, then that person is wasting productivity by not catching fish or cooking dinner for example.
### Chapter 17
- We cannot hold the price of any commodity below its market level without in time bringing about 2 consequences: 
  (i) Increase demand for that commodity, because it is cheaper, people are both tempted to buy & can afford to buy more of it, 
  (ii) Reduce the supply of that commodity because its production is discouraged.
- If the government engages in price fixing, it will not only have to extend price control more & more downwards (“vertically”),it will find it necessary to do so “horizontally”. If we ration one commodity, & the public cannot get enough of it, though it still has excess purchasing power, it will turn to some substitute.
- Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist Papers: “A power over a man’s subsistence amounts to a power over his will”
  There is a misunderstanding of what it is that has been causing prices to rise: Real cause is either a scarcity of goods or a surplus of money. Legal price ceilings merely intensify the shortage of goods.
- Each one of us has multiple economic personalities. Each one is a producer, taxpayer or consumer. The policies he advocates depend upon the particular aspect under which he thinks of himself at the moment.
### Chapter 19
- What distinguishes many reformers (advocates of minimum wage laws) from those who cannot accept their proposals is not their greater philanthropy, but their greater impatience.
  Best way to raise wages is to raise marginal labor productivity. This can be done by many methods: By an increase in capital accumulation - ie by an increase in machines with which workers are aided; By more efficient management on the part of employers; By more industrious & efficiency on the part of workers; By better education & training.
    - Note: With soldiers returning home, it might be that the taxpayer can now spend the saved tax income into the economy, thereby employing the soldier. However, with wage increase the author seems to ignore the fact, that the same can be said. The wage earner will have that much extra to put back into the economy thereby increasing demand for the commodity that would lose demand because its price has been driven higher by higher wages. In his assumptions, things are not as fluid anymore.
      Also he ignores the fact that machines are controlled by a select few. So the marginal labor productivity is not divided among the currently employed labor but gets concentrated/ accumulated by the people higher in the food chain. While the increased productivity is great for the economy & consumers it does not just automatically spread. Its much more complex than giving every worker a screwdriver so they can fasten screws 10x faster than by hand.
### Chapter 21
- The best prices are not the highest prices, but the prices that encourage the largest volume of production & the largest volume of sales. The best wage rates for labor are not the highest wage rates, but the wage rates that permit full production, full employment & the largest sustained payrolls. The best profits (from both industry & labor standpoint) are not the lowest profits, but the profits that encourage most people to become employers or to provide more employment than before.
    - Note: The problem with “best profit” criteria above is that it can potentially get unbounded due to human greed & then ends in severe concentrations.
### Chapter 22
- Corporate profits after taxes in the five years from 1956 to 1960 averaged less than 6% of national income. Corporate profits in the 5 years 1971 through 1975 also averaged less than 6% of national income.
    - Note: How is profit defined? Exec pay would technically be CapEx I guess.
### Chapter 23
- Oldest & most stubborn error on which the appeal of inflation rests is that of confusing “money” with “wealth”.
  Adam Smith: “double function of money, as the instrument of commerce, and as the measure of value ... To grow rich is to get money, and wealth & money in common language are considered synonymous”.
- **Argument against Quantitative Easing:**
  Rigid mechanical theory of the effect of the supply of money on commodity prices. Value of the total quantity of money multiplied by its “velocity of circulation” must always be equal to the value of the total quantity of goods bought. In short, multiply quantities of money n times and you must multiply the prices of goods n times.
  Suppose we divide the community into 4 groups A,B,C,D who get the money income benefit of the inflation in that order. When money incomes of group A have already increased 30%, the prices of things they purchase have not yet increased at all. By the time money incomes of group B have increased 20%, prices have still increased an avg of only 10%. Money income of group C have increased only 10%, however prices have gone up 15%. When money incomes of group D have not increased at all, the avg prices they have to pay for things they buy have gone up 20%. Gains of the first groups of producers to benefit by higher prices or wages from the inflation are necessarily at the expense of the losses suffered (as consumers) by the last groups of produces that are able to raise their prices or wages.
- Present valuation will often depend upon what people expect the future quantity of money to be. When hyperinflation has once set in, the value of the monetary unit drops at a far faster rate than the quantity of money either is or can be increased.
  Real cause of any existing depression: maladjustments within the wage-cost-price structure; maladjustments between wages & prices; between the prices of raw materials & prices of finished goods or between one price or wage and another.
  Inflation is the autosuggestion, the hypnotism, the anesthetic, that has dulled the pain of the operation for him. Inflation is the opium of the people.
### Chapter 24
- When money is invested it is used to buy or build capital goods - houses or office buildings or factories or ships or trucks or machines. Any one of these projects puts as much money into circulation and gives as much employment as the same amount of money spent directly on consumption.
  What is saved on consumers’ goods is spent on capital goods, and that “saving” does not necessarily mean a dollar’s contraction in total spending.
- The effect of keeping interest rates artificially low, in fact, is eventually the same as that of keeping any other price below the natural market. It increases the demand for capital & reduces supply of real capital. It creates economic distortions. While it increases borrowing, it tends to encourage highly speculative ventures that cannot continue except under the artificial conditions that gave them birth.On the supply side it reduces savings & accumulation of capital.
### Chapter 25
- In a specialized economy when an elaborate & minute division of labor has set it, I do not make all the things I consume. I wish the price of everything I buy to be low but it is in my interest for the commodity or service that I sell to be high.
  Solution is never to reduce supplies arbitrarily, to prevent further inventions or discoveries, or to support people for continuing to perform a service that has lost its value.
