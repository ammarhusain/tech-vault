## Highlights
- Introverts and extroverts require different levels of external stimulation to function effectively. Introverts need less outside stimulation—for instance, they prefer to work alone, spend free time alone, or visit with just one or two friends. Extroverts need a lot of stimulation, typically from social activities and busy environments. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/2862381a-2789-44c7-821f-6b4ace6e4563))
- Introverts and extroverts have different work styles. Introverts focus on one task at a time, work methodically, and have a great ability to concentrate. They’re not motivated by external rewards. Extroverts jump into jobs quickly, multitask, take risks, and make quick decisions. They may be motivated by factors such as competition and status.

- Introverts can be sociable but soon tire of being in large groups or parties. They listen, think before speaking, and may express themselves better in writing. They dislike conflict and small talk. Extroverts are gregarious, assertive, dominant, and comfortable with conflict. They don’t like to be alone.

- Another stereotype is that introverts are shy. Although some introverts may be shy, there are key differences between introversion and shyness. Shy people dislike social situations because they’re afraid of embarrassment, while introverts dislike social situations because they’re too stimulating.

- Society often views introversion, which can encompass sensitivity and shyness, as an undesirable personality trait that should be suppressed or changed. Because extroversion has become the norm to which everyone must conform, introverts are left feeling devalued because of an innate quality.
  Research shows we rate people more positively when they have qualities we associate with extroverts. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/945c0e6a-8a95-4444-b4f2-e70b44e1faf1))
- we’ve elevated extroversion to hyper-extroversion and equated it with leadership. It permeates the self-improvement industry, business schools, corporate culture, and even churches. But charismatic leaders aren’t as effective as most people think—in some circumstances, introverted leaders may be more effective.

- We rate fast talkers as more capable than slower ones. The more someone talks, the more attention he draws from the group and the more influential he becomes as the discussion progresses.
  But more talk doesn’t translate to greater insight. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/91d62ef3-e210-4bcb-862a-4c77784061b2))
- corporations don’t need outsized personalities—they need leaders who focus, not on stroking their egos, but on building the business. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/3475f82d-17d5-4acb-ade4-8b4d45e33d99))
- Research has found that creativity requires 1) solitude and 2) intense concentration. Because these are the preferred work styles of introverts, it’s not surprising that many of the most creative people are introverts.

- High-reactive children also tend to more thoroughly process what they’ve observed and to apply more nuance to everyday experiences. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/dc9e10b3-4174-4630-afab-936ebfa2d8a6))
- Reward-seeking gives extroverts the courage to take chances and take on challenges, but it can also get out of hand. An obsession with a big payoff can drive people to act irrationally and ignore clear warning signs. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/4d6601b2-2d1e-40bd-9955-b2a1349dfd4a))
- Extroverts are more likely to focus on what’s happening around them. Introverts tend to sit around wondering about things and making plans. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/d1a1ebcd-c768-4d83-9871-3e53de0b5b61))
- If you’re an introvert, be true to your nature: use your persistence, absorption, imperviousness to rewards, and analytical ability to solve complex problems and avoid pitfalls. Don’t let others rush your deliberations. Stay independent, trust your instincts, and apply your ideas as effectively as you can.

- investor and introvert Warren Buffet, who made billions for himself and shareholders by using persistence, careful analysis, and attention to warning signs. Buffet is known for stepping back to reflect when others are charging heedlessly ahead. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/23541a7c-fe16-4905-be25-ac563cac093c))
- Those who know do not speak. Those who speak do not know. —Lao Tzu ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/e20a21f7-bf9c-46a1-8abb-a48d2a767531))
- You won’t succeed in acting out of character to advance a project you don’t care about. However, introverts may have difficulty identifying their core personal projects because they’re used to ignoring their own preferences and feeling uncomfortable in many situations. For an introvert functioning in an extrovert-dominated world, it’s like spending time in a foreign country —it can be exciting, but you don’t feel like you fit in. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/7a1f426f-a512-4b2d-b7e2-12a158758f3a))
- you don’t want to act out of character for too long because it takes a lot of energy.
  In the process, you need to create “restorative niches,” where you can relax and be yourself. These niches can be a physical place ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/11011640-aeaf-48d0-81a1-862efee26392))
