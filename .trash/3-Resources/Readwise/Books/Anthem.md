## Highlights
- Some day, we shall stop and build a house, when we shall have gone far enough.
  But we do not have to hasten. The days before us are without end, like the forest. (Page 96)
- And now we look upon the earth and sky. This spread of naked rock and peaks and moonlight is like a world ready to be born, a world that waits. It seems to us it asks a sign from us, a spark, a first commandment. We cannot know what word we are to give, nor what great deed this earth expects to witness. We know it waits.
  It seems to say it has great gifts to lay before us, but it wishes a greater gift from us. We are to speak. We are to give its goal, its highest meaning to all this glowing space of rock and sky. (Page 106)
- I stand here on the summit of the mountain. I lift my head and I spread my arms.
  This, my body and spirit, this is the end of the quest. I wished to know the meaning of things. I am the meaning. I wished to find a warrant for being, I need no warrant for being, and no word of sanction upon my being. I am the warrant and the sanction. (Page 108)
- It is my eyes which see, and the sight of my eyes grants beauty to the earth. It is my ears which hear, and the hearing of my ears gives its song to the world. It is my
  mind which thinks, and the judgement of my mind is the only searchlight that can find the truth. It is my will which chooses, and the choice of my will is the only edict I must respect. (Page 109)
- I know not and I care not. 
  For I know what happiness is possible to me on earth. And my happiness needs no higher aim to vindicate it. My happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end. It is its own goal. It is its own purpose. (Page 110)
