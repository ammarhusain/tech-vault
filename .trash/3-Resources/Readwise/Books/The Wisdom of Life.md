## Highlights
### Division of the Subject
- Geothe & Byron's poems: it is open to a foolish reader to envy the poet because so many delightful things happened to him, instead of envying that mighty power of phantasy which was capable of turning a fairly common experience into something so great and beautiful.
- For the highest, most varied and lasting pleasures are those of the mind, however much our youth may deceive us on this point; and the pleasures of the mind turn chiefly on the powers of the mind.
- Goethe says that every man, whether he occupy a low position in life, or emerges as its victor, testifies to personality as the greatest factor in happiness.
- For what a man is in himself, what accompanies him when he is alone, what no one can give or take away, is obviously more essential to him than everything he has in the way of possessions, or even what he may be in the eyes of the world.
- An intellectual man in complete solitude has excellent entertainment in his own thoughts.
- When Socrates saw various articles of luxury spread out for sale, he exclaimed: 'how much there is in the world that I do not want'

- Highest pleasures are those of the intellect, fleeting pleasures are those of the sense
### Personality, or what a man is
- The man who is cheerful and merry has always a good reason for being so - the fact, namely, that he is so.
- So if cheerfulness knocks at our door, we should throw it wide open, for it never comes inopportunely. Instead of that, we often make scruples about letting it in. We want to be quite sure that we have every reason to be contented; then we are afraid that cheerfulness of spirits may interfere with serious reflections or weighty cares.
- It is certain that nothing contributes so little to cheerfulness as riches, or so much as health.
- The inexhaustible activity of thought! Finding ever new material to work upon in the multifarious phenomena of self and nature, and able and ready to form new combinations of them - there you have something that invigorates the mind, and apart from moments of relaxation, sets it far above the reach of boredom.
- For the more a man has in himself, the less he will want from other people - the less indeed, other people can be to him.

- Ariosto observes, how miserable are the idle hours of ignorant men!
- The reason why people of limited intellect are apt to be bored is that their intellect is absolutely nothing more than the means by which the motive power of the will is put into force; and whenever there is nothing particular to set the will in motion, it rests and their intellect takes a holiday.
- No man ought to expect much from others, or in general from the external world. What one human being can be to another is not a very great deal.
- Himself is the source of the best and most a man can be or achieve.
- Happiness means vigorous (mastery) and successful activity in all your undertakings.
- Pleasures that are not of the intellect are of a lower kind; for they are, one and all, movements of will - desires, hopes, fears and ambitions, no matter to what directed; they are always satisfied at the cost of pain. In the case of ambitions, generally with more or less of illusion.

- For the whole of Nature shows that with the growth of intelligence comes increased capacity for pain.
- For a man endowed with high degrees of mental power: What external promptings he wants come from the works of nature, and from the contemplation of human affairs and the achievements of the great of all ages and countries, which are thoroughly appreciated by a man of this type alone, as being the only one who can quite understand and feel with them.
- A man who is privileged in this respect leads two lives, a personal and intellectual, life. And the latter gradually comes to be looked upon as the true one, and the former as merely a means to it.
- My philosophy, for instance has never brought me in a sixpence; but it has spared me many an expense.

- Socrates praised leisure as the fairest of all possessions.
- Goethe: The man who is born with a talent which he is meant to use, finds his greatest happiness in using it.
- Difficilis in otio quies: It is difficult to keep quiet if you have nothing to do.
- For a man endowed with intellect to be happy, he will want precisely that undisturbed leisure which the others find burdensome or pernicious; for without it he is a Pegasus in harness and consequently unhappy.
### Property, or what a man has
- A man never feels the loss of things which it never occurs to him to ask for; he is just happy without them; whilst another, who may have a hundred times as much, feels miserable because he has not got the one thing he wants.
- People who are not born with a fortunes, but end by making a large one through the exercise of whatever talents they possess, almost always come to think that their talents are their capital, and that the money they have gained is merely the interest upon it. They do not lay by a part of their earnings to form a permanent capital, but spend it as they earn it.
- Voltaire: We have only two days to live; it is not worth our while to spend them in cringing to contemptible rascals.
### Position, or a man's place in the estimation of others
##### Reputation
- The sphere of what we are for other people is their consciousness, not ours; it is the kind of figure we make in their eyes, together with the thoughts which this arouses.
- What goes on in other people's consciousness is, as such, a matter of indifference to us: and in time we get really indifferent to it, when we come to see how superficial and futile are most people's thoughts, how narrow their ideas, how mean their sentiments, how perverse their opinions, and how much of error there is in most of them.

- If people were generally converted from this universal folly (of worrying about what was said of them behind their backs), the result would be such an addition to our peace of mind and cheerfulness as at present seems inconceivable; people would present a firmer and more confident front to the world, and generally behave with less embarrassment and restraint.
- In a retired mode of life, we thus escape having to live constantly in the sight of others, and pay everlasting regard to their casual opinions.
##### Pride
- 'Pride' is an established conviction of one's own paramount worth in some particular respect; while 'vanity' is the desire of rousing such a conviction in others, and it is generally accompanied by the secret hope of ultimately coming to the same conviction oneself.
  Pride works from within, while vanity from without.
  Anyone who wishes to affect pride is not therefore a proud man.

##### Rank
- Rank: It has a purely conventional value. Strictly speaking it is a sham; its method is to exact an artificial respect, and, as a matter of fact, the whole thing is a mere farce.
##### Honour
- There are 3 main kinds of honour: civic honour, official honour, and sexual honour.
- When a man has made that surrender of himself in marriage which is so advantageous to his conqueror, he shall take care that the terms of the treaty are maintained; both in order that the agreement itself may lose none of its force by the permission of any laxity in its observance, and that men, having given up everything, may, at least, be assured of their bargain, namely exclusive possession.
- A man's relation to woman is subordinate to many other and more important affairs in his life.
- Once, for instance when somebody kicked him, the patience with which he took the insult surprised one of his friends. Do you think, said Socrates, that if an ass happened to kick me, I should resent it?
- Civic honour aims at peacable intercourse, and consists in the opinion of other people that we deserve full confidence. Knightly honour, on the other hand, lays down that we are to be feared, as being determined at all costs to maintain our own.
- Women did not occupy that prominent place in ancient society which they hold now, when conversation has taken on a frivolous and trifling character, to the exclusion of the weighty discourse which distinguished the ancients. This change has certainly contributed a great deal to bring about the tendency, to prefer personal courage to the possession of any other quality. The fact is that personal courage is really a very subordinate virtue - a virtue in which we are surpassed by the lower animals.
- A man must himself have but a poor opinion of his own worth who hastens to prevent the utterance of an unfavorable opinion by giving his enemy a black eye.
- True appreciation of his own value will make a man really indifferent to insult; but if he cannot help resenting it, a little shrewdness and culture will enable him to save appearances and dissemble his anger.
##### Fame
- We should not be surprised if people are pleased with themselves, and fancy that they are in good case; for to a dog the best thing in the world is a dog; to an ox an ox, and to an ass an ass.
- Hamlet: A knavish speech sleeps in a fool's ear.
  Goethe: A dull ear mocks at the wisest word.
- The more a man belongs to posterity, to humanity in general, the more of an alien he is to his contemporaries.
- Lichtenberg: Works like this are as a mirror: if an ass looks in, you cannot expect an apostle to look out.
- Goethe declares that if we had to depend for our life upon the favour of others, we should never have lived at all; from their desire to appear important themselves, people gladly ignore our very existence.
- Other people's heads are a wretched place to be the home of a man's true happiness - a fanciful happiness perhaps, but not a real one.

- It is only work done from the heart that ever gains the laurel.

- If a man is famed far and wide in his own life-time, he will, if he is wise, not set too much value upon it, because it is no more than the echo of a few voices, which the chance of a day has touched in his favor.
- Intellectual superiority consists in forming theories, that is, new combinations of certain facts.
