## Highlights
- I bore daily witness to the seemingly cramped lives of my grandparents, the disappointments they filled with TV and liquor and sometimes a new appliance or car. (Page 12)
- The study of law, it turned out, wasn't so different from what I'd done during my years of solitary musing on civic questions. What principles should govern the relationship between the individual and society, and how far did our obligations to others extend? How much should the government regulate the market? How does social change happen, and how can rules ensure that everybody has a voice? (Page 27)
- I was almost forty, broke, coming off a humiliating defeat and with my marriage strained. I felt for perhaps the first time in my life that I had taken a wrong turn; that whatever reservoirs of energy and optimism I thought I had, whatever potential I'd always banked on, had been used up on a fool's errand. Worse, I recognized that in running for Congress I'd been driven not by some selfless dream of changing the world, but rather by the need to justify the choices I had already made, or to satisfy my ego, or to quell my envy of those who had achieved what I had not.
  In other words, I had become the very thing that, as a younger man, I had warned myself against. I had become a politician-and not a very good one at that. (Page 56)
- I experienced a certain letting go-if not of desire to make a difference in the world, then at my least of the insistence that it had to be done on a larger stage. What might have begun as a sense of resignation at whatever limits fate had imposed on my life came to feel more like gratitude for the bounty it had already delivered. (Page 58)
- But no sooner had the story begun to die down than* the media exploded yet again,
  that*
  .typo (Page 165)
- The excitement was fun and at times deeply touching, but it was also a little unnerving. At some basic level people were no longer seeing me, I realized, with all my quirks and shortcomings. Instead, they had taken possession of my likeness and made it a vessel for a million different dreams. I knew a time would come when I would disappoint them, falling short of the image that my campaign and I had helped to construct. (Page 206)
- They'd given me a chance. Through the noise and chatter of the political circus, they'd heard call for something different. Even if I hadn't always been at my best, they'd divined what was best in me: the voice insisting that for all our differences, we remained bound as one people, and that, together, men and women of goodwill could find a way to a better future.
  I promised myself I would not let them down. (Page 227)
- But the continuing elevation of me as a symbol ran contrary to my organizer's instincts, that sense that change involves "we" and not "me." It was personally disorienting, too, requiring me to constantly take stock to make sure I wasn't buying into the hype and remind myself of the distance between the airbrushed image and the flawed, often uncertain person I was. (Page 297)
- For a brief moment, before trumpets sounded and I was announced, I closed my eyes and summoned the prayer that had carried me here, one I would continue to repeat every night I was president.
  A prayer of thanks for all I'd been given. A prayer that sins be forgiven. A prayer that my family and the American people be kept safe from harm.
  A prayer for guidance. (Page 349)
- And while they were uniformly glad to have well-paying, secure jobs with good benefits, it was hard to miss in their racial makeup the vestiges of an earlier time, when social rank had clear demarcations and those who occupied the office of president felt most comfortable in their privacy when served by those they assumed were not their equalsand, therefore, could not judge them. (Page 384)
- Confidence, of course, is hard to convey if you don't fully feel it. Still bruised by the confirmation hearings having spent his first few weeks on the job working with only a skeleton staff, and still sorting out the details of how the stress test would work, Tim stepped before a bank of TV cameras and financial journalists that day and promptly tanked. (Page 428)
- They were dangerous, these young men, often deliberately and casually cruel Still, in the aggregate, at least, I wanted somehow to save them-send them to school, give them a trade, drain them of the hate that had been filling their heads.
  And yet the world they were a part of, and the machinery I commanded, more often had me killing them instead. (Page 537)
- If some of the students chafed against the way the government blocked their access to websites, they likely experienced the full weight of China's repressive apparatus mainly as an abstraction, as remote from their personal experience as the U.S. criminal justice system might be to middle-class, suburban white kids back home. For the entirety of their lives, China's system had lifted them and their families along an upward trajectory, while from a distance, at least, Western democracies seemed stuck in neutral, full of civic discord and economic inefficiency. (Page 732)
- Getting things done meant subjecting yourself to criticism, and the alternative-playing it safe, avoiding controversy, following the polls-was not only a recipe for mediocrity but a betrayal of the hopes of those citizens who'd put you in office.
  Still, as time went by, I couldn't help but fume. (Page 751)
- FDR understood that to be effective, governance couldn't be so antiseptic that it set aside the basic stuff of politics: You had to sell your program, reward supporters, punch back against opponents, and amplify the facts that helped your cause while fudging the details that didn't. I found myself wondering whether we'd somehow turned a virtue into a vice; whether, trapped in my own high-mindedness, I'd failed to tell the American people a story they could believe in; and whether, having ceded the political narrative to my critics, I was going to be able to wrest it back. (Page 798)
- Each day had its share of aggravations, worries, and disappointments. I'd stew over mistakes I'd made and question strategies that hadn't panned out. There were meetings I dreaded, ceremonies I found foolish, conversations I would have rather avoided. While I continued to refrain from yelling at people, I cursed and complained plenty, and felt unfairly maligned at least once a day. (Page 819)
- But as I'd discovered about myself during the campaign, obstacles and struggles rarely shook me to the core. Instead, depression was more likely to creep up on me when I felt useless, without purposewhen I was wasting my time or squandering opportunities. (Page 819)
- Like me, he had come to believe that this was all any of us could expect from democracy, especially in big, multiethnic, multireligious societies like India and the United States. Not revolutionary leaps or major cultural overhauls; not a fix for every social pathology or lasting answers for those in search of purpose and meaning in their lives. Just the observance of rules that allowed us to sort out or at least tolerate our differences, and government policies that raised living standards and improved education enough to temper humanity's baser impulses. (Page 917)
- I sometimes ponder the age old question of how much difference the particular characteristics of individual leaders make in the sweep of history - whether those of us who rise to power are mere conduits for the deep, relentless currents of the times or whether we're at least partly the authors of what's to come. I wonder whether our insecurities and our hopes, our childhood traumas or memories of unexpected kindness carry as much force as any technological shift or socioeconomic trend. (Page 965)
- I studied the thirty or so elite military members seated before me in folding chairs. Some of them looked the part-strapping young men whose muscles bulged through their uniforms. But I was struck by how many of them could have passed for accountants or high school principals guys in their early forties, with graying hair and understated demeanors.
  They were a testament to the role that skill and judgment born of experience played in successfully navigating the most dangerous missions-experience. (Page 1066)
