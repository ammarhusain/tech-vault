## Highlights
- Phases for the ultimate power:
  Apprenticeship : we stand on the outside of our field, learning as much as we can of the basic elements and rules. 
  CreativeActive : through much practice and immersion, we see into the inside of the machinery, how things connect with one another, and thus gain a more comprehensive understanding of the subject. With this comes a new powerthe ability to experiment and creatively play with the elements involved. 
  Mastery : our degree of knowledge, experience, and focus is so deep that we can now see the whole picture with complete clarity. (Page 5)
- When we reach mastery, intuition is a power at our command, the fruit of working through the lengthier process. (Page 6)
- Finally, you must not see this process of moving through levels of intelligence as merely linear, heading toward some kind of ultimate destination known as mastery.
  Your whole life is a kind of apprenticeship to which you apply your learning skills. (Page 13)
- Unconsciously, you might feel that what makes you different is embarrassing or painful. If these counterforces become strong enough, you can lose complete contact with your uniqueness, with who you really are. Your inclinations and desires become modeled on those of others. (Page 24)
- The game you want to play is different: to instead find a niche in the ecology that you can dominate.
  Once you have mastered your first field, you look for other subjects or skills that you can conquer, on your own time if necessary. (Page 30)
- Scoff at the need for attention and approval-they will lead you astray.
  You are committed to your Life's Task, to giving it full expression. It is up to you to find it and guide it correctly. It is not up to others to protect or help you. You are on your own. (Page 32)
- The moment you rigidly follow a plan set in your youth, you lock yourself into a position, and the times will ruthlessly pass you by. (Page 33)
- In the end, the money and success that truly last come not to those who focus on such things as goals, but rather to those who focus on mastery and fulfilling their Life's Task. (Page 34)

- We spend too much time entangled in emotional issues, and we never quite have enough detachment to reflect and learn from our experiences. (Page 47)

- Goal of an apprenticeship:
  Transformation of your mind and character.
  It is the time of youth and adventure-of exploring the world with an open mind and spirit. (Page 48)
- First, you will observe the rules and procedures that govern success in this environment. But what is of more interest are the rules that are unstated and are part of the underlying work culture.
  You are like a hunter: your knowledge of every detail of the forest and of the ecosystem as a whole will give you more options for success.
  You will develop the habit of stilling your ego. You will develop a keen eye for human psychology and strengthen your ability to focus. (Page 52)
- We learn best through practice and repetition - the natural learning process.
  Once you take this far enough, you enter a cycle of accelerated returns in which the practice becomes easier and more interesting, leading to the ability to practice for longer hours, which increases your skill level, which in turn makes practice even more interesting. (Page 55)
- Your sense of pleasure becomes redefined. What offers immediate pleasure comes to seem like a distraction, an empty entertainment to help pass the time. Real pleasure comes from overcoming challenges, feeling confidence in your abilities, gaining fluency in skills, and experiencing the power this brings. (Page 56)
- 10,000 hours generally adds up to seven to ten years sustained, solid practice. (Page 57)
- If you are not careful, you will accept this status and become defined by it. Instead, you must struggle against any limitations and continually work to expand your horizons. Being exposed to ideas in the wide world, you will tend to develop a hunger for more and more knowledge; you will find it harder to remain satisfied in any narrow corner, which is precisely the point. (Page 62)
- You must try to revert to a childlike feeling of inferiority-the feeling that others know much more your task is to learn and absorb as much as possible. For than you and that you are dependent upon them to learn and safely navigate your apprenticeship. You have no fears. (Page 64)
- You resist the temptation to be nice to yourself. You become your own worst critic. Resist the lure of washing on your focus. You train yourself to concentrate in practice with double the intensity. 
  Your five hours of intense, focused work are the equivalent of ten for most people. (Page 66)
- Failure : It is like working on a machine: when a device malfunctions you do not take it personally or grow despondent. Mistakes and failures are precisely your means of education. They tell you about your own inadequacies. (Page 67)
- Combine the “how” and the “what” to gain a much deeper and rounded knowledge.
  Scientists and technicians live in their own world, focusing mostly on the "how" of things.
  Others live in the world of appearances, using these things but not really understanding how they function.
  Just before this split occurred, it was the ideal of the Renaissance to combine these two forms of knowledge. (Page 69)
- You avoid the trap of following one set career path, You are not sure where this will all lead, but you taking full advantage of the openness of information. (Page 71)
- ABSORB THE MASTER'S POWER: THE MENTOR DYNAMIC
  Without any guidance, you can waste valuable years trying to gain knowledge and practice from various sources. Instead, you must follow the example set by Masters throughout the ages and find the proper mentor. The mentor protégé relationship is the most efficient (Page 73)
- To learn requires a sense of humility. We must admit that there are people out there who know our field much more deeply than we do. Their superiority is not a function of natural talent or privilege, but rather of time and experience. (Page 86)
- To reach mastery requires some toughness and a constant connection to reality.
  Masters have experienced endless criticisms of their work, doubts about their progress, setbacks along the way. 
  You must get the sharpest dose of reality that is possible from your mentor. You must go in search of it and welcome it. (Page 93)
- SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE: Often the greatest obstacle to our pursuit of mastery comes from the emotional drain we experience in dealing with the resistance and manipulations of the people around us. The principal problem we face in the social arena is our naïve tendency to project onto people our emotional needs and desires of the moment.
  By moving past our usual self absorption, we can learn to focus deeply on others, reading their behavior in the moment, seeing what motivates them, and discerning any possible manipulative tendencies. (Page 98)
- Benjamin Franklin was struck by an apparent paradox: when it came to his work, he was supremely rational and realistic, always looking to improve himelf. But with people it was virtually the opposite: he would inevitably become swept up in his emotions and lose all contact with reality.
  He resolved that in all of his future interactions with people, he would force himself to take an initial step backward and not get emotional. From this more detached position, he would focus completely on the people he was dealing with, cutting off his own insecurities and desires from the equation. They would all be maneuvers on a chessboard. (Page 103)
- Social intelligence means moving past our tendency to idealize and demonize people, and seeing and accepting them as they are.
  Naïve Perspective : you will focus only on what other people have done to you the mistreatments you endured from them, the slights or injuries you felt. You must turn this around and begin with yourself - how you saw in others qualities they did not possess, or how you ignored signs of a dark side to their nature. (Page 108)
- You cannot change people at their core, but must merely avoid becoming their victim. You are an observer of the human comedy, and by being as tolerant as possible, you gain a much greater ability to understand people and to influence their behavior when necessary. (Page 109)
- Take particular note of people's actions and decisions. Your goal is to figure out the hidden motives behind them, which will often revolve around power. (Page 111)
- Most of us have these seven deadly realities - Envy, Conformism, Rigidity, Self-obsessiveness, Laziness, Flightiness, and Passive Aggression. (Page 112)
- Be wary of people who want to collaborate - they are often trying to find someone who will do the heavier lifting for them. 
  Do not take so seriously people's promises or their ardor in wanting to help you. Rely upon yourself to get things done and you will not be disappointed. (Page 116)
- Speak through your work
  Be efficient and detail oriented in what you do. By remaining focused and speaking socially through your work, you will both continue to raise your skill level and stand out. (Page 119)
- Craft the appropriate persona 
  If you are not careful, they will begin to ascribe to you all kinds of qualities that have little to do with who you are but correspond to what they want to see.
  You never set on one image or give people the power to completely figure you out. You are always one step ahead of the public.
  By creating a persona that is mysterious, intriguing, and masterful, you are playing to the public, giving them something compelling and pleasurable to witness. You are allowing them to project their fantasies onto you. You must take pleasure in creating these personas–it will make you a better performer on the public stage. (Page 120)
- Seeing events from the perspective of the other people involved will loosen the lock our emotions have on our self-image, and help us understand the role we play in our own mistakes. 
  Develop increasing self-detachment – the ability to see ourselves as we really are. (Page 121)
- Suffer fools gladly
  Natural tendency with folks is to lower yourself to their level. 
  Fools are simply a part of life, like rocks or furniture. All of us have foolish sides, moments in which we lose our heads and think more of our ego or shortterm goals. It is human nature. It is all part of the human comedy, and it is nothing to get upset about or lose sleep over.
  Height of wisdom, is to actually exploit their foolishness-using them for material for your work, as examples of things to avoid, or by looking for ways to turn their actions to your advantage. (Page 123)
- Instead of feeling complacent about what you know, you must expand your knowledge to related fields, giving your mind fuel to make new associations between different ideas. As your thinking grows more fluid your mind will become increasingly dimensional, seeing more and more aspects of reality. (Page 126)
- Masters not only retain the spirit of the Original Mind, but they add to it their years of apprenticeship and an ability to focus deeply on problems or ideas. This leads to high-level creativity.
  They retain a childlike excitement about their field and a playful approach. (Page 137)
- Dimensional Mind : Such a mind is not constricted by limited experience or habits. It can branch out in all directions and make deep contact with reality. It can explore more dimensions of the world. It is active, transforming everything it digests into something new and original, creating instead of consuming. (Page 138)
- If you are worried about what others might think and about how your position in the group might be jeopardized, or about failure or going through a period of mental and financial instability, then you will never really create anything. Think of yourself as an explorer. You cannot find anything new if you are unwilling to leave the shore. (Page 143)
- We literally close ourselves off from the world in order to concentrate on what is necessary. This can have the unintended consequence of making it harder for us to see other possibilities, to be more open and creative with our ideas. (Page 146)
- Focus our attention on some need that is not currently being met, on what is absent. This requires more thinking and is harder to conceptualize, but the rewards can be immense if we hit upon this unfulfilled need. One interesting way to begin such a thought process is to look at new and available technology in the world and to imagine how it could be applied in a much different way, meeting a need that we sense exists but that is not overly apparent. (Page 154)
- Emotional Pitfalls to watch out for:
  Complacency
  Conservatism
  Dependency
  Impatience
  Grandiosity (Page 159)
- The greatest impediment to creativity is your impatience, the almost inevitable desire to hurry up the process, express something, and make a splash.
  The best route is to love learning its own sake. (Page 163)
- This technical lock afflicts people in all fields as they lose a sense of the overall purpose of their work, of the larger question at hand, of what impels them to do their work in the first place. To avoid this, your project or the problem you are solving should always be connected to something larger-a bigger question, an overarching idea, an inspiring goal.
  This bigger idea governs your smaller paths of investigation, and opens up many more such paths for you to look into. (Page 171)
- Instead of a straight-line development from idea to fruition, the creative process is more like the crooked branching of a tree.
  The lesson is simple-what constitutes true creativity is the openness and adaptability of our spirit. When we see or experience something we must be able to look at it from several angles, to see other possibilities beyond the obvious ones. (Page 172)
- Fire the intuitive with the rational: Through intense immersion over mапy years we come to internalize and gain an intuitive feel for the complicated components of our field. When we fuse this intuitive feel with rational processes, we expand our minds to the outer limits of potential ino and are able to see into the secret core of life itself. (Page 176)
- We don't simply absorb information-we internalize it and make it our own by finding some way to put this knowledge to practical use. We look for connections between the various elements we are learning, hidden laws that we can perceive in the apprenticeship phase. If we experience any failures or setbacks, we do not quickly forget them because they offend our self-esteem. Instead we reflect on them deeply, trying to figure out what went wrong and discern whether there are any patterns to our mistakes. As we progress, we start to question some of the assumptions and conventions we have learned along the way. (Page 190)
- We can define intelligence as moving toward thinking that is more contextual, more sensitive to the relationships between things.
  The brain of a Master is so richly interconnected that it comes to resemble the physical world, and becomes a vibrant ecosystem in which all forms of thinking associate and connect. (Page 197)
- We gain such power by first transforming ourselves into consummate observers. We see everything in our surroundings as a potential sign to interpret. Nothing is taken at face value. There are the people with whom we work and interact--everything they do and say reveals something hidden below the surface. (Page 199)
- The artificial barriers between the arts and the sciences will melt away under the pressure to know and to express our common reality. Our ideas will become closer to nature, more alive and organic. In any way possible, you should strive to be a part of this universalizing process, extending your own knowledge to other branches, further and further out. (Page 207)
