## Highlights
### How will you Measure your Life?
- Questions to ask yourself: How can I be happy in my career? How can I be sure that my relationship with my family is an enduring source of happiness? And how can I live my life with integrity?
- If you’re not guided by a clear sense of purpose, you’re likely to fritter away your time and energy on obtaining the most tangible, short term signs of achievement, not whats really important to you.
- If you study business or personal disasters, you’ll find a predisposition toward endeavors that offer immediate gratification.
- Its easier to hold to your principles 100% of the time than it is to hold to them 98% of the time.
- If your attitude is that only smarter people have something to teach you, your learning opportunities will be very limited.
### Managing Oneself
- We must each be our own CEO. Its upto you to carve out your place in the work world and know when to change course. Its upto you to keep yourself engaged & productive. Cultivate a deep understanding of yourself.
- What are your most valuable strengths & most dangerous weaknesses?
  - Use feedback analysis. Everytime you make a key decision write down your expected outcome.Compare to what you get.
  - What results are you skilled at generating? What abilities do you need to enhance, in order to get the results you want?
  - What unproductive habits are holding you back?
- How do you learn & work with others?
  - Do you process information by reading it or by hearing others discuss?
  - Do you accomplish most by working alone or with others?
  - Do you perform best while making decisions, or while advising?
  - Are you in top form when things get stressful or in a highly predictable environment?
- What are your most deeply held values? Where do I belong?
  - What are your most important responsibilities for living a worthy, ethical life?
  In what type of work environment can you make the greatest contribution?
  - Figure out what could be your greatest contribution?
  Only when you operate from a combination of your strengths & self knowledge can you achieve true excellence.
### Who’s got the Monkey?
- “We’ve got a problem”. You assume you should get involved but can’t make an on the spot decision. You say “Let me think about it”.
  You’ve just allowed a “monkey” to leap from your subordinate’s back to yours. You’re now working for your subordinate.
  Monkeys must be fed or shot. Otw they will starve to death & valuable time is wasted on postmortems.
- When an employee tries to hand you a problem: i) clarify whether he should recommend & implement a solution, ii) take action then brief you immediately, or iii) act & report the outcome at a regular update.
  When you encourage employees to handle their own monkeys, they acquire new skills - and you liberate time to do your own job.
- How to return monkeys to their proper owners:
  - Avoid discussing any monkey on an ad-hoc basis- for ex passing in the hallway.
  - Your employees have 5 levels of initiative
  - Wait until told what to do.
  - Ask what to do
  - Recommend an action, then with your approval implement it.
  - Take independent action but advise you at once.
  - Take independent action & update you in a routine way.
  - Outlaw use of 1 & 2. Agree on & assign 3, 4 or 5 & take no more than 15 mins to discuss.
- Some managers secretly worry that by relinquishing control they appear less strong, more vulnerable & less useful. Cultivate an inward sense of security.
- Employees hand of monkeys when they lack desire or ability to handle them. Its initially more time consuming to help them develop the skills at first, but more rewarding long term.
### How Resilience Works
- Resilience is something you realize you have, after the fact.
  Apply these practices:
  **Face down reality:** Instead of slipping into denial or victimhood, take a sober down to earth view of the reality of your situation. You’ll prepare yourself to act in ways that enable you to endure.
  **Search for Meaning:** Build a bridge from your present day ordeal to a fuller, better future.
  **Continually Improvise**
### Manage your Energy, not your Time
- Employ simple rituals: take brief breaks at specific intervals, show more appreciation, reduce interruption,spend more time on activities people do best.
- Physical Energy:
  - Exercise, enhance sleep & cut alcohol.
  - Eat small meals/ light snacks every 3 hours
  - Take brief breaks every 90-120 minutes (ultradian rhythm)
  Emotional Energy:
  - Deep abdominal breathing to diffuse negative emotions: irritability, impatience, anxiety, insecurity
  - Take a third person view to problems rather than thinking problems define you (not in book)
  Mental Energy:
  - Reduce interruptions by setting systems & processes
  - Respond to emails, chats & phones at designated times
  - Every night identify the most important challenge for the next day.
  Spiritual Energy:
  - Live your core values. For ex: if consideration is important to you, but you’re perpetually late for meetings, practice intentionally showing up 5 mins early.
### Overloaded Circuits
- Attention Deficit Trait (ADT): distractibility, inner frenzy, & impatience. Have difficulty staying organized, setting priorities & managing time.
  Foster positive emotions by connecting face to face with people you like throughout the day. Take physical care of your brain by getting enough sleep, eating healthfully & exercising regularly. Organize for ADT, designating part of each day for thinking & planning, keep your surroundings clutter free.
- “Only handle it once” (OHO) rule for email or any other communication, file etc.
  “Close door” button on an elevator is often the one with the paint worn off.
### Be a Better Leader, Have a Richer Life
- Bear leadership in all of life’s domains - work, home, community & self (mind, body & spirit). Of course there will always be some tension among the different roles we play.
  Achieve “four way wins” - not trading off one for another but finding mutual value among them.
- Friedmans Total Leadership process: Articulate who and what matters most in your life. Then experiment with small changes that enhance your satisfaction & performance in all four domains. Pick the 3 most important experiments and do them. Record your activities and try to make the outcome measurable.
### What to Ask the Person in the Mirror
- Ask the following questions to yourself as a leader:
  How often do I communicate a vision & key priorities to achieve my vision?
  Does the way I spend my time match my key priorities?
  Do I give people timely & direct feedback they can act on?
  Have I identified potential successors?
  How do I behave under pressure?
  Does my leadership style reflect who I truly am?
  Am I attuned to changes that might require strategic shifts?
  Do I assert myself sufficiently or have I become tentative? Does worry about my next promotion or my year end bonus cause me to pull punches or hesitate to clearly express my views?
- A business career is a marathon, not a sprint, and if you aren’t true to yourself, eventually you’re going to wear down.
### Primal Leadership
- Executives’ emotional intelligence- their self awareness, empathy, rapport with others - has clear links to their own performance: mood contagion
  High functioning people generally feel more optimistic about their prospects and possibilities than average performers.
