## Payments

#### [[2023-07-03-Monday]] - Check #1 = **$9539.42**

Permit fees = $1097.32 + Time fees = $180 -> Total = $1277.32
10% contract = $8262.10

#### [[2023-07-18-Tuesday]] - Check #2 = **$5528.10**

Paid for 50% of electrical work
[[home remodel-2023-07-18.jpeg]]

#### [[2023-07-28-Friday]] - Check #3 = $14,055.92

[[Progressive payment No.1 117 Topaz way .pdf]]

#### [[2023-08-04-Friday]] - Check #4 = $12,828.03

[[Progressive payment No.2 117 Topaz way .pdf]]

#### [[2023-08-30-Wednesday]] - Check #5 = $20,206.45

[[Progressive payment No.3 117 Topaz way .pdf]]

#### [[2023-09-23-Saturday]] - Check #6 = 70% of $24,395.26 (invoice #4) = $17076.68
[[Progressive payment No.4 117 Topaz way .pdf]]

#### [[2023-09-30-Saturday]] - Check #7 = 30% of  $24,395.26 (invoice #4) = $7318.58

#### [[2023-10-20-Friday]] - Check #8 = $8000 (not aligned on final number yet)
For all out of main contract work: [[Progressive payment No.5 117 Topaz way .pdf]] = $4,088.18
[[Progressive payment No.6 117 Topaz way .pdf]] = $13,325.35 (???)

Redoing invoice #6 because it does not make sense:
Pending items to pay:
Invoice #5 = $4,088.18
5% of total bathrooms ($25565) = $1278.25
#2 original contract  (carpet removal) = $3300
#3 original contract (flooring install) = $6475
50% of #10 original contract (remove 2 walls - $2866) = $1433
60% of #11 original contract (enclose master bathroom & closet - $4275) = $2565
#18 original contract (drawings) = $780
For locks + baseboards = $1,156.00
#16 staining = $2070
total = $23145.43
= $19919.43 (without #16)

minus 10% initial contract deposit = -$8262.10

My calculation pending balance = $14,883.33

His calculation pending balance = $17,413.53

6880+3300+6475+2325+4320+15000+12035+4960+9780+2866+4275+750+95+2650+380+2070+3750+780 = 82,691

#### [[2023-11-06-Monday]] - Check #9 = $6413.63
Updated invoice #6 that has the items listed out better: [[Progressive payment No.6 117 Topaz way 2 nov .pdf]]
Full balance less $3000 for final inspection
#### [[2023-12-22-Friday]] - Check #10 = $3358 (Final)

$3000 (balance) + $738 (Change order fireplace) - $380 (electric lock) = $3358
Change order for added fire place inspection:  [[Change order 117 Topaz way 19 dec.pdf]]
Installed only 7 locks and did not install electronic lock so subtract: $95 + $380.

# #journal/meditations
- Figure out what order the parts are needed and in what order - its easy to get all the decor ones first and miss out on the rough in parts
- Sometimes its better to just visit a few stores and check out stuff in person rather than endlessly researching online
	- Parts are not necessarily cheaper online
- Never tell your contractor he's doing a great job - keep the pressure on
- Figure out what part of the project can be parallelized - then find multiple people to do that rather than purely relying on one guy. But also be careful in parallelizing too much - it can lead to slowdowns. Eg: painting & Jose's finishing up - both got in each others way.
- Go to big box stores to get areas measured & designed for freeHome Depot, Floor & Decor, Lamps Plus, IKEA
	- Then go to local (Chinese usually) building supply stores to get the parts for cheaper (in the case of Home Depot)
- Figure out when key tasks will happen - counter stone cutting, tiling, floor install etc and make yourself available. They will have tons of design questions
- Do not rush to buy parts - you might end up ordering the wrong or unnecessary ones. Its easy to get excited and order them - just wait until the time is ready but figure out their lead times.
- [[2023-11-01-Wednesday]]:  Discovered a leak in the living room that is stemming from the master bath toilet. The flange of the toilet is leaking and will need to be replaced. We could see this over time as the paint around the recess light was peeling off. Initially suspected that this was just shitty patching job by the painter. Turns out water was creeping through that light cutout in the ceiling. Eventually it was peeled enough that water was dripping down and wet the couch. Can never be sure what might go wrong - but at least we know now where all the pipes are.

Contacted a bunch of painters on Thumbtack
Got Pedro to come out in the evening for an estimate

[[2023-08-26-Saturday]]
Dan at 115 was enraged and stormed into our property to yell at Jose & the guys. They abandoned work and left mid-way.
Long drawn out back & forth with him on what the HOA vs SF city policy is on working Saturdays. Turns out he was just flexing power.
Met Shobha aunty in the meanwhile.

[[2023-08-25-Friday]]
Kitchen stone cutting day
It was super hectic and chaotic. Jose had no clue of all the kitchen mechanisms that needed to be hooked up and parts were all over the place. Got organized and made good progress. He starts claiming that they will be done in less than a week now.
Had to move coffee with Santiago amid all the chaos.

[[2023-08-23-Wednesday]]
IKEA closet design: Get Elvarli designed & ordered for linen space
Can we get 5% discount if we just order online?
How much would you charge for full install? including closet doors

[Get an estimate Custom Cut Glass - Call Us Fab Glass and Mirror](https://www.fabglassandmirror.com/showerdoorsraq/thankyou) - submitted a request online, waiting on callback

[[2023-06-05-Monday]] Visited Excel plumbing on Van Ness - more convinced to get steam room built rather than prefab unit
Sent out old HOA form - [[arc-form-hoa-old.pdf.pdf]]

[[2023-05-23-Tuesday]] Called a bunch of fireplace people

- [Heat & Glo Cosmo Indoor Gas Fireplace Insert – Energy House](https://energy-house.com/product/heat-glo-cosmo-indoor-gas-fireplace-insert/)
	- frank@energy-house.com: said around $5-7k including install
- [Kidd fireplace installs – Kidd Fireplace](https://kiddfireplace.com/kidd-fireplace-installs/)
	- They dont do install but will send other installers to do it - price not any cheaper than Okells 6-8k just for unit + 1.5k+ for install
Also called:
- [Gas & Wood Fireplace Inserts | San Francisco Bay Area | Warm Solutions](https://warmsolutions.com/services/fireplace/gas-wood-fireplace-inserts/)
- [Gas Inserts for Sale in Burlingame | SDI Fireplaces](https://www.sdi-fireplaces.com/gas-insets)
	- Scheduled an appointment for [[2023-06-06-Tuesday]] - they might not do chimney demo though so that sucks. Could ask Jose
Had saved in Todoist: [Fireplace Xtrordinair Available at Creative Energy](https://www.creativeenergy.com/fireplace-brand/fireplace-xtrordinair/)

[[2023-05-05-Friday]]
BV Electric came by. Says about $450 per can light. Can schedule within a week and will take them 1-2 days to get done.

[[2023-04-13-Thursday]]: Mark Anderson from Lowes:
	- 3mm insulated layer underneath flooring for thermal & sound insulation. Says he ll find out more about creaking
	- Quote did not include flooring on stairs, just carpeting. Thats probably why it was so much cheaper.

Hussain brother:

- Q-cells, solaria & Enphase for inverter.

[[2023-04-12-Wednesday]]Brain dump from Adil

- NEM-2 is the current phase of CA government benefit for installing solar panels at home.
	- It cost him 26k. Enphase was the company that the monitor was from, panels from LG
	- Look at Tesla, Costco and his referral. Says the Afghan guy is great
	- 30% tax rebate from Federal government on install cost
- They have a handyman that they can send our way. Hourly, straightforward work.
- Fireplace - got for ~2.8k and had their foreman install it - Look at their company
- Kitchen cabinets were from Home Depot - 18.5k total (Thomasville prolly). Door handles they said were expensive there so went someplace else. Counter stone could get a fab guy to do if Jose knows someone, rather than buying from Home Depot. They only just got the cabinets from there
